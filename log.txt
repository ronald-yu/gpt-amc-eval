1) Cities $A$ and $B$ are $45$ miles apart. Alicia lives in $A$ and Beth lives in $B$. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at $18$ miles per hour. Leaving at the same time, Beth bikes toward $A$ at $12$ miles per hour. How many miles from City $A$ will they be when they meet? $A) 20 B) 24 C) 25 D) 26 E) 27$
Solution: E
Model Final Answer #1: E
Model Answer #1: Imagine that the two girls were both biking towards each other at the same time. They would be biking towards each other at a combined speed of $18+12=30$ mph. They would be biking together for a total of $\frac{45}{30}=1.5$ hours. Since Alicia bikes at a rate of $18$ mph, she would have biked a total of $18(1.5)=27$ miles. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{27\text{ (E)}}$.

Model Final Answer #2: E
Model Answer #2: Suppose that Alicia and Beth meet after $t$ hours. Then Alicia has traveled $18t$ miles and Beth has traveled $12t$ miles. Since they start $45$ miles apart, we have $18t+12t=45$ or $30t=45$ or $t=\frac{45}{30}=\frac{3}{2}$ hours. Therefore, Alicia has traveled $18\cdot\frac{3}{2}=27$ miles. The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }27}$

----

Model Final Answer #3: E
Model Answer #3: The two bikers ride towards each other at a combined speed of $18 + 12 = 30$ mph.  The time it takes for them to meet is $45\text{ mi}/30\text{ mph} = 3/2$ h, so Alicia will have biked $18\text{ mph} \times 3/2\text{ h} = \boxed{27}\text{ miles}$.

Model Final Answer #4: E
Model Answer #4: Let $d$ be the distance from City $A$ to the meeting point.  It follows that the distance from City $B$ to the meeting point is $45-d$.  Since Alicia and Beth are traveling at $18$ and $12$ miles per hour, respectively, we can write the following equation: $$\frac{d}{18} = \frac{45-d}{12}.$$Cross-multiplying, we get $12d = 18(45-d)$. Expanding the right side gives $12d = 18 \cdot 45 - 18d$, and simplifying gives $30d = 18\cdot 45$.

Dividing both sides by $30$ gives $d = \frac{18\cdot 45}{30} = 27$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{27 \text{ (E)}}$.

----

Model Final Answer #5: E
Model Answer #5: We can think of Beth and her bike as a single object and Alicia and her bike as another object. The combined speed of both objects is $18+12=30$ miles per hour. Since they are $45$ miles apart, they will meet in $\frac{45}{30}=\frac{3}{2}$ hours. In that time, Alicia will have travelled $18\cdot\frac{3}{2}=\boxed{27}$ miles.

----

Model Final Answer #6: E
Model Answer #6: When they meet, they will have traveled a total of $45$ miles. If $x$ is the distance that Alicia has traveled, then Beth has traveled $45-x$ miles. We know that Alicia bikes at $18$ miles per hour and Beth at $12$ miles per hour. So, we have the equation $18x+12(45-x)=45$. Simplifying this equation gives $6x=45-12(45)=9$, or $x=3/2$. Therefore, Alicia will be $\boxed{27}$ miles from city $A$ when they meet.

----

Model Final Answer #7: E
Model Answer #7: When they meet, they will have traveled a total of 45 miles. Let $x$ be the number of miles Alicia will have traveled when they meet. Since Alicia bikes at a speed of 18 miles per hour, she will have traveled $\frac {x}{18}$ hours. Similarly, since Beth bikes at a speed of 12 miles per hour, she will have traveled $\frac {45 - x}{12}$ hours. Since they leave at the same time, $\frac {x}{18} = \frac {45 - x}{12}$. Solving this equation gives us $x = \boxed{27}$ miles.

----

Model Final Answer #8: E
Model Answer #8: To get the answer, we need to find out how long it takes for them to meet.  The formula to find time is distance divided by rate.  Therefore, the time it takes for them to meet is $\frac{45}{18+12} = \frac{45}{30} = \frac{3}{2}$ hours.  Alicia goes $18 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 9 \cdot 3 = 27$ miles.  Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{27\ \text{(E)}}$.

----

Model Final Answer #9: C
Model Answer #9: If they meet $n$ hours after they start, then we have $18n+12n=45$, so $n=3$ and they meet $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }25}$ miles from city $A$.

----

Model Final Answer #10: E
Model Answer #10: If you have a good sense of numbers, you see that $18$ and $12$ are in the ratio of $3:2$. This means that Alicia is biking $3/5$ the speed of the total speed and Beth is biking $2/5$ the speed of the total speed. So when they meet, they will be $\frac{3}{5} \cdot 45 = 27\rightarrow \boxed{\textbf{(E)}\;27}$ miles from city $A$

2) The weight of $\frac{1}{3}$ of a large pizza together with $3 \frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is the same weight of $\frac{3}{4}$ of a large pizza together with $\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices. A cup of orange slices weigh $\frac{1}{4}$ of a pound. What is the weight, in pounds, of a large pizza? $A) 1\frac{4}{5} B) 2 C) 2\frac{2}{5} D) 3 E) 3\frac{3}{5}$
Solution: A
Model Final Answer #1: A
Model Answer #1: Let $x$ represent the weight of the large pizza in pounds. 
Therefore, we can set up the equation $\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{7}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}x+\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{4}$. Simplifying this equation, we have $\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{7}{8}=\frac{3}{4}x+\frac{1}{8}$. 
Multiplying both sides by 8, we have $8\cdot\frac{1}{3}x+8\cdot\frac{7}{8}=8\cdot\frac{3}{4}x+8\cdot\frac{1}{8}$, which simplifies to $\frac{8}{3}x+7=6x+1$. 
Subtracting $6x$ from both sides, we have $\frac{8}{3}x-6x+7=1$. Simplifying this equation, we have $-\frac{10}{3}x+7=1$. Subtracting 7 from both sides, we have $-\frac{10}{3}x=-6$. 
Dividing both sides by $-\frac{10}{3}$, we have $x=1\frac{4}{5}$. 
Thus, the weight of the large pizza is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }1\frac{4}{5}}$.

----

Model Final Answer #2: A
Model Answer #2: Let the weight of the large pizza be $x$. Then we have \[\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{7}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{4}.\] Simplifying the left side gives us \[\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{7}{8} = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{1}{8}.\] Multiplying both sides by 8 gives us \[8 \cdot \frac{1}{3}x + 7 = 8 \cdot \frac{3}{4}x + 1.\] Simplifying gives us \[\frac{8}{3}x + 7 = 6x + 1.\] Subtracting $6x$ and 1 from both sides gives us \[\frac{8}{3}x - 6x = 1 - 7.\] Simplifying gives us \[\frac{8}{3}x - 6x = -6.\] Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us \[8x - 18x = -18.\] Simplifying gives us \[-10x = -18.\] Dividing both sides by $-10$ gives us $x = \frac{9}{5} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }1\frac{4}{5}}$.

Model Final Answer #3: abstain
Model Answer #3: Let $p$ be the weight of the pizza.  Then $\frac{1}{3}p + \frac{7}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}p + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4}$.  Multiplying through by $4$ gives $\frac{4}{3}p + 7 = 3p + \frac{1}{2}$, so $\frac{4}{3}p - 3p = -\frac{1}{2} - 7 = -\frac{15}{2}$, and $\frac{5}{3}p = \frac{15}{2} = \frac{30}{4} = \frac{10}{4} \cdot \frac{15}{2} = 5 \cdot \frac{15}{2}$.  Thus $p = \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{15}{2} = \frac{45}{10} = \boxed{4\frac{1}{2}}$.

----

Model Final Answer #4: B
Model Answer #4: Let's call the weight of the pizza $p$ and set up an equation to represent the problem. We know that $\frac{1}{3}p + (3\frac{1}{2})\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) = \frac{3}{4}p + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)$. Simplifying the right side gives $\frac{1}{3}p + \frac{7}{8} = \frac{3}{4}p + \frac{1}{8}$. Subtracting $\frac{1}{3}p$ and $\frac{1}{8}$ from both sides gives $\frac{5}{8} = \frac{5}{12}p$. Multiplying both sides by $\frac{12}{5}$ gives $p = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }2}$.

----

Model Final Answer #5: C
Model Answer #5: Let $x$ be the weight of a large pizza.  We are told that $\frac{1}{3}x + 3 \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4}$.  Multiplying both sides by 4 to clear fractions, we have $\frac{4}{3}x + 7 = 3x + \frac{1}{2}$.  Subtracting $3x$ and $\frac{1}{2}$ from both sides, we have $\frac{4}{3}x - 3x = -\frac{1}{2} + 7$, which simplifies to $\frac{4}{3}x - 3x = \frac{13}{2}$.  Multiplying both sides by 3, we have $4x - 9x = \frac{39}{2}$, which simplifies to $-5x = \frac{39}{2}$.  Dividing both sides by $-5$, we have $x = -\frac{39}{10}$.  The weight of a pizza cannot be negative, so the answer is $\boxed{2\frac{2}{5}}$.

Model Final Answer #6: abstain
Model Answer #6: Let the weight of a large pizza be $x$ pounds.  The weight of $\frac13$ of a large pizza is $\frac{x}{3}$ pounds, and the weight of $3\frac12$ cups of orange slices is $3\frac12\cdot\frac14=\frac78$ pounds.  The weight of $\frac34$ of a large pizza is $\frac34x$ pounds, and the weight of $\frac12$ cups of orange slices is $\frac12\cdot\frac14=\frac18$ pounds.  We can set up the equation $\frac{x}{3}+\frac78=\frac34x+\frac18$.  Multiplying both sides by 8 gives $8\cdot\left(\frac{x}{3}+\frac78\right)=8\cdot\left(\frac34x+\frac18\right)$, or $\frac{8x}{3}+7=\frac{6x}{4}+1$.  Simplifying the right side gives $\frac{8x}{3}+7=\frac{3x}{2}+1$.  Subtracting $\frac{8x}{3}$ and 1 from both sides gives $6=\frac{x}{6}$, so $x=6\cdot6=\boxed{36}$ pounds.

Model Final Answer #7: A
Model Answer #7: Let $p$ be the weight of the pizza in pounds. The weight of $\frac{1}{3}$ of the pizza is $\frac{1}{3}p$. The weight of $3 \frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is $3 \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{8}$ pounds. The weight of $\frac{3}{4}$ of the pizza is $\frac{3}{4}p$. The weight of $\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{8}$ pounds. We can write the following equation: \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{3}p + \frac{7}{8} &= \frac{3}{4}p + \frac{1}{8} \quad \implies \\
8p + 7 &= 6p + 1 \quad \implies \\
2p &= -6 \quad \implies \\
p &= \boxed{\textbf{(A) } 1\frac{4}{5}}.
\end{align*}

Model Final Answer #8: A
Model Answer #8: Let the weight of a large pizza be $w$. Then we have $\frac{1}{3}w+3\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}w+\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{4}$. Simplifying the equation gives us $\frac{1}{3}w+\frac{7}{8}=\frac{3}{4}w+\frac{1}{8}$, so $\frac{5}{8}w=\frac{3}{8}$, which means $w=\boxed{\textbf{(A) }1\frac{4}{5}}$.

Model Final Answer #9: abstain
Model Answer #9: Let the weight of the pizza be $p$ pounds. The weight of the orange slices is $3.5\cdot\frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{8}$ pounds. Therefore, we have $\frac{1}{3}p+\frac{7}{8} = \frac{3}{4}p + \frac{1}{2}$. Simplifying, we have $\frac{11}{24}p=\frac{3}{8}$, so $p=\frac{3}{2}=\boxed{1\frac{1}{2}}$.

Model Final Answer #10: C
Model Answer #10: Let $w$ be the weight of a large pizza. We can write the equation $\frac{w}{3} + \frac{7}{2} = \frac{3}{4}w + \frac{1}{2}$. Simplifying gives $\frac{w}{3} = \frac{5}{4}w - \frac{5}{2}$. Clearing the fractions gives $4w = 15w - 30$, so $w = \boxed{2\frac{2}{5}}$.

3) How many positive perfect squares less than $2023$ are divisible by $5$? $A) 8 B) 9 C) 10 D) 11 E) 12$
Solution: A
Model Final Answer #1: B
Model Answer #1: The largest perfect square less than $2023$ is $44^2=1936<2023$. The smallest perfect square greater than $2023$ is $45^2=2025>2023$. The perfect squares less than $2023$ are $1^2,2^2,3^2,\ldots,44^2$. We look for the perfect squares that are divisible by $5$, which are $5^2,10^2,15^2,\ldots,40^2$. The total number of perfect squares that are divisible by $5$ is $\frac{40}{5}=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }9}$.

----

Model Final Answer #2: A
Model Answer #2: The perfect squares less than $2023$ are $1^2, 2^2, \dots, 44^2$, so there are $44$ of them.  The perfect squares divisible by $5$ are $5^2, 10^2, \dots, 40^2$, so there are $8$ of them.  The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }8}$.

----

Model Final Answer #3: C
Model Answer #3: Consider the perfect squares less than $2023$ whose prime factorization does not contain $5$. The largest square that satisfies this condition is $44^2 = 1936$. Thus, all the squares that satisfy the condition in the problem are simply all the squares less than $44^2$ that are divisible by $5$; there are $\left\lfloor \frac{44^2}{5} \right\rfloor = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 10}$ such numbers.

----

Model Final Answer #4: D
Model Answer #4: We are looking for perfect squares that are divisible by $5$. Since $5$ has a units digit of $5$ or $0$, these perfect squares must have a units digit of $0$ or $5$. Therefore, we need to find the squares of the numbers $0$, $5$, $10$, $15$, $20$, $\dots$, $40$. We list them and divide by $5$: \begin{align*}
0^2 &= 0, \\
5^2 &= 25, \\
10^2 &= 100, \\
15^2 &= 225, \\
20^2 &= 400, \\
25^2 &= 625, \\
30^2 &= 900, \\
35^2 &= 1225, \\
40^2 &= 1600. \\
\end{align*}There are $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }11}$ perfect squares less than $2023$ that are divisible by $5$.

----

Model Final Answer #5: D
Model Answer #5: Note that the smallest square which is a multiple of $5$ is $25$. The largest square which is a multiple of $5$ and less than $2023$ is $2025=45^2$. This means that there are $45-5+1=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 11}$ positive perfect squares less than $2023$ which are divisible by $5$.

----

Model Final Answer #6: B
Model Answer #6: The perfect squares less than $2023$ are $1^2,2^2,\dots,44^2$. For a perfect square to be divisible by $5$, its square root must be divisible by $5$. The numbers $5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45$ are the perfect squares that are divisible by $5$, so there are $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }9}$ perfect squares less than $2023$ that are divisible by $5$.

----

Model Final Answer #7: B
Model Answer #7: The squares of consecutive integers are $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, \ldots$.  Every fifth square is a multiple of $5$, so we need to find the largest square that is less than $2023$.  The largest square less than $2023$ is $44^2 = 1936$, so there are $44/5 = 8.8$ squares divisible by $5$.  The largest square less than $2023$ is $45^2 = 2025$, so there are $45/5 = 9$ squares less than $2023$.  Therefore, the number of positive perfect squares less than $2023$ that are divisible by $5$ is $\boxed{9}$.

----

Model Final Answer #8: D
Model Answer #8: The largest perfect square less than $2023$ is $44^2=1936<2023$. The perfect squares less than $1936$ that are divisible by $5$ are $25,100,225,\ldots, 1764 = 42^2$. Thus, the perfect squares less than $2023$ that are divisible by $5$ are $5^2,6^2,\ldots,44^2$, of which there are $44-5+1=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }11}$

----

Model Final Answer #9: B
Model Answer #9: The largest square less than $2023$ is $45^2=2025$, and the largest square divisible by $5$ is $40^2=1600$.  The perfect squares from $25^2$ to $45^2$ are divisible by $5$, so there are $45-25+1=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 9}$ squares less than $2023$ which are divisible by $5$.

----

Model Final Answer #10: C
Model Answer #10: The problem is asking us to find the number of perfect squares less than $2023$ that are divisible by $5$. Instead of listing out all perfect squares less than $2023$, we can list out the first few perfect squares and their residue modulo $5$.
\[1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}\]
\[2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{5}\]
\[3^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{5}\]
\[4^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}\]
\[5^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}\]
\[6^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}\]
\[7^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{5}\]
\[8^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{5}\]
\[9^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}\]
\[10^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}\]
We notice that the numbers $\{5, 10, 15, 20, \ldots , 2020\}$ are divisible by $5$. There are $404$ numbers in this list, but $1$ is a perfect square that is divisible by $5$. Therefore, we have $403$ perfect squares less than $2023$ that are divisible by $5$. However, we also need to count the perfect square that is equal to $2020$. Since $45^2 = 2025 > 2020$, we know that $44^2 < 2020 < 45^2$. Therefore, we have $44$ perfect squares that are less than $2023$ and divisible by $5$, and our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 10}$.

4) A quadrilateral has all integer side lengths, a perimeter of $26$, and one side of length $4$. What is the greatest possible length of one side of this quadrilateral? $A) 9 B) 10 C) 11 D) 12 E) 13$
Solution: D
Model Final Answer #1: C
Model Answer #1: Let the side lengths of the quadrilateral be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ in clockwise order. Since $a,b,c,d$ are integers, we know that $a+d$ and $b+c$ must be even. We also know that $a+b+c+d=26$. 
Since one of the sides must be $4$, we know that $4+a+d+b+c=26$, so $a+d+b+c=22$. $a+d$ and $b+c$ must be even, so $a+d$ and $b+c$ must be either $(2,20)$ or $(4,18)$. The maximum possible side length is $a+d$, so our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 11}$.

----

Model Final Answer #2: D
Model Answer #2: The sum of the lengths of the other three sides is $26-4=22$. The greatest possible length of one of the other sides is then $22-1-1=20$, and then the greatest possible length of the remaining side is $20-2=18$. Thus the greatest possible length of one side of this quadrilateral is $\boxed{18\text{(D)}}$.

----

Model Final Answer #3: abstain
Model Answer #3: Let the lengths of the other three sides be $a$, $b$, and $c$. We are trying to maximize one of these integers. Since the perimeter is $26$, we must have that \[a + b + c = 26 - 4 = 22.\] This implies that one of $a$, $b$, or $c$ must be greater than or equal to $8$. The other two sides combine to give an integer less than or equal to $14$, so the greatest possible length of one of these two sides is $7$. Therefore, the largest side length is $8 + 7 = \boxed{15}$.

----

Model Final Answer #4: B
Model Answer #4: Let the quadrilateral have side lengths $a$, $b$, $c$, and $4$, in clockwise order. Then $a+b+c=22$. By the Triangle Inequality on $\triangle abc$, $a+b>c$, so $c<22-c$. Since all side lengths must be positive integers, $c\leq 10$. Then $a+b>12$, so $a+b\geq 13$. The greatest possible value of $a$ or $b$ is $\boxed{10}$, which is achievable if $a=10$ and $b=3$.

----

Model Final Answer #5: A
Model Answer #5: Let $a,b,c,d$ be the four side lengths. We have $a+b+c+d=26$ and $a=4.$ We want to maximize $d$. Thus we only need to maximize $b+c+d$. We have $a+b+c+d=4+b+c+d=26$, so $b+c+d=22$. Since $b,c,d$ are integers, $b+c+d$ is at most $9+8+5=22$, which occurs when $b=9$, $c=8$, and $d=5$. Thus the greatest possible value of one side of the quadrilateral is $\boxed{9}$.

----

Model Final Answer #6: A
Model Answer #6: Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the lengths of the other sides. Then we have $a+b+c=26-4=22$. By the Triangle Inequality, \begin{align*}
a + b &> c \implies a+b \geq c+1, \\
a+c &> b \implies a+c \geq b+1, \\
b+c &> a \implies b+c\geq a+1.
\end{align*} Summing these inequalities gives $2(a+b+c)\geq 2(a+b+c)+3$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, no such quadrilateral exists. $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 9}$

Model Final Answer #7: B
Model Answer #7: We let the length of the second side be $a.$ We can write a system of equations as follows: \begin{align*}
a+b+c+d&=26, \\
a+b+c+d&=26, \\
a+b+c+d&=26, \\
4+a+c+d&=26. \\
\end{align*} The only possible values of $a$ are $9,10,11,12,$ and $13.$ We check each value. \begin{align*}
9+b+c+d&=26, \\
10+b+c+d&=26, \\
11+b+c+d&=26, \\
12+b+c+d&=26, \\
13+b+c+d&=26. \\
\end{align*} The values of $b, c,$ and $d$ for each equation are $13, 12, 11, 10,$ and $9,$ respectively. The largest value is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 10}.$

----

Model Final Answer #8: C
Model Answer #8: The sum of the lengths of the other three sides is $26-4=22$. In order for all three side lengths to be integers, the greatest possible length of one of the other three sides is $\left\lfloor\frac{22}{2}\right\rfloor=11$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 11}$.

----

Model Final Answer #9: D
Model Answer #9: Let the lengths of the other three sides be $a$, $b$, and $c$. The perimeter is $4 + a + b + c = 26$, so $a + b + c = 22$. By the triangle inequality, we have $a + b > c$, $b + c > a$, and $c + a > b$. The sum of the first two inequalities is $a + 2b + 2c > a + b + c = 22$, so $a + b + c > 22$. Since $a + b + c = 22$, we have $a + b + c = 23$. Since $a + b > c$, $b + c > a$, and $c + a > b$, we must have $a + b = c + 1$, $b + c = a + 1$, and $c + a = b + 1$. Adding these inequalities gives $2a + 2b + 2c = 2(a + b + c) = 2(23) = 46$, so $a + b + c = \frac{46}{2} = 23$. Thus, $a = 11$, $b = 10$, and $c = 12$, so the greatest possible length is $\boxed{12}$.

----

Model Final Answer #10: C
Model Answer #10: Let $a$, $b$, $c$ be the other three side lengths. By the Triangle Inequality, $a + b + c > 4$. Since $a, b, c$ are integers, $a + b + c \geq 5$, and $a + b + c = 5$ is impossible because $4$ is one of the side lengths. Hence $a + b + c \geq 6$ and $a + b + c = 6$ is possible. Two possible triples $(a, b, c)$ are $(1, 1, 4)$ and $(1, 2, 3)$. The first triple gives $a + b > c$ ($2 > 4$) and the second triple gives $c + b > a$ ($4 > 1$). Hence, the only possible value of $a + b + c = 6$ is $a = 4$, $b = 1$, $c = 1$. Therefore, the greatest possible length of one side is $\boxed{11}$.

5) How many digits are in the base-ten representation of $8^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 15^5$? $A)  14  B) 15  C) 16  D) 17  E)  18$
Solution: E
Model Final Answer #1: D
Model Answer #1: $8^5=(2^3)^5=2^{15}$, so we are multiplying $2^{15} \cdot 5^{10} \cdot (3 \cdot 5)^5=2^{15} \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^5=2^{15} \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 5^5=2^{15} \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^{15}=10^{15} \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^5$. $10^{15}$ has $16$ digits (a $1$ and $15$ zeros), and $3^5 \cdot 5^5$ has $10$ digits (see Solution 1). Therefore, our number has $16+10=\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 17}$ digits.

Model Final Answer #2: B
Model Answer #2: We have  \begin{align*}
8^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 15^5 &= (2^3)^5 \cdot (5^1)^{10} \cdot (3^1 \cdot 5^1)^5 \\
&= 2^{15} \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^5 \\
&= 2^{15} \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 5^5 \\
&= 2^{15} \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^{15}.
\end{align*} We have $2^{15} \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^{15} = 2^{15} \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 5^5 = 2^{15} \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^5 = (2 \cdot 5)^{10} \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^5 = 10^{10} \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^5$.

We have $10^{10} = 10,000,000,000$, which has $10$ digits.  Also, $3^5 \cdot 5^5 = 15^5 = 15 \cdot 15 \cdot 15 \cdot 15 \cdot 15 = (10 + 5)(10 + 5)(10 + 5)(10 + 5)(10 + 5)$ $= \cdots +$ some multiple of $10^5$, so $3^5 \cdot 5^5$ has $5$ more digits.  Therefore, $2^{15} \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 5^5$ has $10 + 5 = \boxed{15}$ digits.

Model Final Answer #3: E
Model Answer #3: Firstly, let's notice that $15^5 = (3\cdot 5)^5 = 3^5 \cdot 5^5$.
Now, let's rewrite our expression: $8^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 15^5 = 2^{15} \cdot 5^{15} \cdot 3^5$.
Now, we know that the number of digits in a number $N$ is equal to the floor of the logarithm of $N$ to the base $10$ plus $1$. Therefore, we can calculate:
\begin{align*} \log_{10}(2^{15} \cdot 5^{15} \cdot 3^5) &= \log_{10}(2^{15}) + \log_{10}(5^{15}) + \log_{10}(3^5)\\ &= 15\log_{10}(2) + 15\log_{10}(5) + 5\log_{10}(3)\\ &\approx 15\cdot 0.301 + 15\cdot 0.699 + 5\cdot 0.477\\ &= 4.515 + 10.485 + 2.385\\ &\approx 17.385 \end{align*}
Therefore, there are $\boxed{18}$ digits in the base-ten representation of $8^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 15^5$.

Model Final Answer #4: E
Model Answer #4: We can rewrite the expression as $8^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot (3\cdot5)^5 = 8^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^5 = (8\cdot3)^5 \cdot 5^{10}\cdot5^5=(24)^5\cdot5^{15}$. Since $24^5$ is approximately $10^7$ and $5^{15}$ is exactly $10^{15}$, the product is equal to $10^7\cdot10^{15}=10^{22}$. The number $10^7$ has $8$ digits and the number $10^{15}$ has $16$ digits, so the number $10^{22}$ has $8+16=\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 18}$ digits.

Model Answer #5: The base-ten representation of a number $n$ has $\lfloor \log_{10} n \rfloor + 1$ digits. We have \begin{align*}
8^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 15^5 &= 2^{15} \cdot 5^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 3^5 \\
&= 2^{15} \cdot 5^{15} \cdot 3^5 \\
&= (2 \cdot 5 \cdot 3)^{15} \cdot 3^5 \\
&= 30^{15} \cdot 3^5.
\end{align*} Since $\log_{10} 30^{15} \approx 15 \log_{10} 30 \approx 15 \cdot 1.48 = 22.2$ and $\log_{10} 3^5 \approx 5 \log_{10} 3 \approx 5 \cdot 0.48 = 2.4,$ the number $30^{15} \cdot 3^5$ has $\lfloor 22.2 + 2.4 \rfloor + 1 = 24$ digits. The answer is $\boxed{24}$.

Model Final Answer #6: C
Model Answer #6: We have $8^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 15^5 = (2^3)^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot (3 \cdot 5)^5 = 2^{15} \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^{15}$.  We know that $2^{10} = 1024$, which is between $10^3 = 1000$ and $10^4 = 10000$, so $2^{15}$ is between $1000 \cdot 2^5 = 32000$ and $10000 \cdot 2^5 = 320000$.  Similarly, $3^5$ is between $100 \cdot 3^2 = 900$ and $1000 \cdot 3^2 = 9000$.  Finally, $5^{15}$ is between $10000$ and $100000$.  Multiplying these three numbers together, we see that $8^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 15^5$ is between $32000 \cdot 900 \cdot 10000 = 320 \cdot 900 \cdot 1000000 = 32 \cdot 9 \cdot 10^8 = 288 \cdot 10^8$ and $320000 \cdot 9000 \cdot 100000 = 32 \cdot 9 \cdot 10^{11}$.  In either case, the number has $2+8 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }16}$ digits.

Model Final Answer #7: E
Model Answer #7: We have $8^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 15^5=2^{15} \cdot 5^{15} \cdot 3^5$. We want to find the number of digits in this number, so we take the logarithm base 10. $\log 2^{15} \approx 15 \cdot 0.3 =4.5$, $\log 5^{15} \approx 15 \cdot 0.7 = 10.5$, and $\log 3^5 \approx 5 \cdot 0.5 = 2.5$. Adding these up, we have that $\log (2^{15} \cdot 5^{15} \cdot 3^5) \approx 17.5$ so our answer is $\boxed{18}$, or $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}}$.

Model Answer #8: We have $8^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 15^5 = 2^{15} \cdot 5^{15} \cdot 3^5 = 10^{15} \cdot 3^5$.  Since $3^5 = 243 < 10^3 = 1000$, the number has $\boxed{15}$ digits.

Model Final Answer #9: D
Model Answer #9: We have $8^5 \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 15^5 = 2^{15} \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 3^{10}$. We want to determine the number of digits in the base-ten representation of this product. To do this, we can determine the magnitude of the number by ignoring the base-ten representation and computing the number of digits in the product. We have $2^{15} \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 3^{10} = 2^{15} \cdot (5^{10} \cdot 3^{10}) = 2^{15} \cdot 15^{10}$. Now, we can approximate this value. We know that $10^3 < 15^4 < 2^{10} < 15^5 < 2^{15} < 15^6 < 2^{20} < 15^7$. Thus, $2^{15} \cdot 15^{10}$ is a number with $10 \cdot 3 = 30$ digits. We have overestimated the number of digits since $15^{10}$ is less than $15^7$. Nevertheless, by doing this we can see that the number of digits in $2^{15} \cdot 15^{10}$ is between $30$ and $35$, thus the number of digits in $2^{15} \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 3^{10}$ is between $30$ and $35 + 10 + 10 = 55$. The number $2^{15} \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 3^{10}$ contains $30$ digits, so the number $2^{15} \cdot 5^{10} \cdot 3^{10}$ is a $30$-digit number. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }17}$

Model Final Answer #10: abstain
Model Answer #10: We can write $15^5$ as $3^{10} \cdot 5^5$, so the given expression becomes $8^5 \cdot 3^{10} \cdot 5^{10}$.  Writing out the prime factorizations of $8^5$ and $3^{10}$, we get $2^{15}$ and $3^{10}$, so $8^5 \cdot 3^{10} \cdot 5^{10} = 2^{15} \cdot 3^{10} \cdot 5^{10}$.  Since the prime factorizations of $2^{15}$ and $3^{10}$ do not contain any $5$s or $0$s, the number of digits in the base-ten representation is equal to the number of digits in $5^{10} = 10^5$, which is $\boxed{6+1 = \boxed{7}}$.

6) An integer is assigned to each vertex of a cube. The value of an edge is defined to be the sum of the values of the two vertices it touches, and the value of a face is defined to be the sum of the values of the four edges surrounding it. The value of the cube is defined as the sum of the values of its six faces. Suppose the sum of the integers assigned to the vertices is $21$. What is the value of the cube? $A)  42  B)  63  C)  84  D)  126  E)  252$
Solution: D
Model Final Answer #1: C
Model Answer #1: We proceed by casework on the number of vertices which are 0.
Case 1: 0 vertices are 0. Then each vertex must be 1. The value of the cube is $6 \cdot (1+1+1+1) = 24$.
Case 2: 1 vertex is 0. WLOG let this vertex be $A$, and let the other vertices be $B,C,D,E,F,G,H$. Then the sum of the vertices is $0 + B+C+D+E+F+G+H = 21$, so $B+C+D+E+F+G+H = 21$. The value of the cube is then $6 \cdot ((B+C)+(B+D)+(B+E)+(B+F)+(H+C)+(H+D)+(H+E)+(H+F)) = 6 \cdot (4B+4H+3C+3D+3E+3F) = 6 \cdot (4(B+H) + 3(C+D+E+F)) = 6 \cdot (4(21-0) + 3(C+D+E+F)) = 6 \cdot (84 + 3(C+D+E+F))$. Since the value of the cube must be a multiple of 3, the value is a multiple of $6 \cdot 3 = 18$, and the only answer choice which is a multiple of 18 is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 84}$.
Case 3: 3 vertices are 0. WLOG let these vertices be $A,B,C$. Then the sum of the vertices is $0+0+0+D+E+F+G+H = 21$, so $D+E+F+G+H = 21$. The value of the cube is then $6 \cdot (2D+2E+2F+2G+2H) = 12 \cdot (D+E+F+G+H) = 12 \cdot 21$. Since the value of the cube must be a multiple of 3, the value is a multiple of $12 \cdot 3 = 36$, and the only answer choice which is a multiple of 36 is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 84}$.

Model Final Answer #2: abstain
Model Answer #2: The value of the cube is equal to the sum of the values of each of its faces. Each vertex of the cube is counted twice when summing the values of the faces, so the value of the cube is half the sum of the integers assigned to the vertices. Therefore, the value of the cube is $\frac{21}{2} = \boxed{10\frac{1}{2}}.$

Model Final Answer #3: A
Model Answer #3: Let $a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h$ be the values assigned to the vertices of the cube. We seek $a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h$. The sum of the four edges surrounding any face is twice the value of the face, so the sum of the values of the six faces is twice the value of the cube. Since the sum of the values assigned to the vertices is $21$, we have \[2(a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h) = 21 \cdot 4 = 84,\] so $a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h=\boxed{42}$.

Model Final Answer #4: C
Model Answer #4: Let the vertices of the cube be $a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h$. Without loss of generality, let $a=1$. Then we have $1+b+c+d+e+f+g+h=21$, which gives $b+c+d+e+f+g+h=20$. Since there are $12$ edges, the sum of their values is $2(b+c+d+e+f+g+h)=40$. Since there are $6$ faces, the sum of their values is $4(40)=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }84}$.

Model Final Answer #5: A
Model Answer #5: Each vertex is a part of 3 edges, and each edge is a part of 2 faces. Since there are 8 vertices and 12 edges, each vertex is part of exactly 3 edges and each edge is part of exactly 2 faces.  The sum of the edges is $\frac{1}{2}$ of the sum of the faces, and the sum of the vertices is $\frac{1}{4}$ of the sum of the edges.

The sum of the vertices is $21$, so the sum of the edges is $21\cdot4=84$.  The sum of the faces is $\frac{84}{2}=42$, so the value of the cube is $\boxed{42}$.

Model Final Answer #6: C
Model Answer #6: Let the vertices of the cube be $A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H$ such that $ABCD$ is a square and $EFGH$ is a square, and the two squares are parallel. Then, by symmetry, $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ have the same value. Also, $A+B+C+D+E+F+G+H=21$, so $2(A+B+C+D)=21$, giving $A+B+C+D=10.5$. The value of the cube is the value of the two squares, so the answer is $2(2(A+B+C+D)+4(A+B+C+D))=2(6(A+B+C+D))=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 84}$

Model Final Answer #7: E
Model Answer #7: Let the vertices have values $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, and $f$ such that $a+b+c+d+e+f=21$. Each edge has value $a+b$, $b+c$, $c+d$, $d+e$, $e+f$, or $f+a$, and each vertex is the endpoint of three edges, so the sum of the values of the edges is $3(a+b+c+d+e+f)=63$. Each face has value $(a+b)+(b+c)+(c+d)+(d+e)+(e+f)+(f+a)=2(a+b+c+d+e+f)=42$, and the sum of the values of the faces is $6\cdot42=\boxed{252}$.

----

Model Final Answer #8: B
Model Answer #8: Each vertex is used in $3$ edges and $3$ faces.  Therefore, the sum of the values of the edges is $21\cdot 3/2 = 31.5$ and the sum of the values of the faces is $21\cdot 3/2 = 31.5.$  Therefore, the sum of the values of the edges and faces is $31.5 + 31.5 = 63,$ so the value of the cube is $\boxed{63}.$

----

Model Final Answer #9: C
Model Answer #9: We know that the sum of the integers assigned to the vertices is $21$, so each vertex has an average value of $\frac{21}{8}$. Now, consider a given vertex. It is a part of three different faces, and the sum of the values of these three faces is equal to the sum of the values of the three edges that the given vertex is a part of. However, each edge is a part of two faces, so the sum of the values of the three edges is twice the sum of the values of the three faces, or $2\left(\text{value of the cube}\right)$. Therefore, the value of the cube is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 21=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 84}$.

----

Model Final Answer #10: D
Model Answer #10: Any vertex will appear in exactly three edges, so its value will be counted exactly three times in the sum of the values of the edges. Since there are eight vertices, the sum of the values of the edges is three times $21$, or $63$. Any edge will appear in exactly two faces, so its value will be counted exactly twice in the sum of the values of the faces. Since there are twelve edges, the sum of the values of the faces is twice $63$, or $126$. Thus the value of the cube is $\boxed{126}$.

7) Janet rolls a standard $6$-sided die $4$ times and keeps a running total of the numbers she rolls. What is the probability that at some point, her running total will equal $3?$ $A) \frac{2}{9} B) \frac{49}{216} C) \frac{25}{108} D) \frac{17}{72} E) \frac{13}{54}$
Solution: B
Model Final Answer #1: A
Model Answer #1: We can solve this problem using recursion. Let $P_n$ be the probability that at some point in the sequence, her running total equals $n.$ We are looking for $P_3.$
There are two ways for a running total to equal $n:$
The running total on the last roll is $1$ and at some point during the sequence, the running total equaled $n - 1.$
The running total on the last roll is $2$ and at some point during the sequence, the running total equaled $n - 2.$
Therefore,
\[P_n = \frac16P_{n-1} + \frac16P_{n-2}\]for $n \ge 3.$
Since $P_1 = \frac16$ and $P_2 = \frac{1}{6^2} = \frac{1}{36},$ we can compute
\begin{align*} P_3 &= \frac16P_2 + \frac16P_1 = \frac16 \cdot \frac{1}{36} + \frac16 \cdot \frac16 \\ &= \frac{1}{216} + \frac{1}{36 \cdot 6} = \frac{1}{216} + \frac{1}{216} \\ &= \frac{2}{216} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) } \frac{2}{9}}. \end{align*}

----

Model Final Answer #2: B
Model Answer #2: We can find the probability that Janet never rolls a $3$ by finding the probability that she rolls something other than a $3$ each time. The probability that she never rolls a $3$ on a single roll is $\frac{5}{6}$. Since each roll is independent, we can multiply the probabilities together to find the probability that she never rolls a $3$ over all four rolls. This probability is $\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296}$. The probability that she rolls a $3$ at some point is the complement of the probability that she never rolls a $3$, so this probability is $1 - \frac{625}{1296} = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{49}{216}}$.

----

Model Final Answer #3: B
Model Answer #3: We can use recursion to solve this problem. Let $P_n$ be the probability that the running total is $n$ after some number of rolls. We want to find $P_3.$
$P_0=1$ since the running total starts at $0.$
If $n \le -1,$ then $P_n=0.$
If $n \ge 7,$ then $P_n=0.$
Otherwise, we have
\begin{align*} P_n &= \frac{1}{6}P_{n-1}+\frac{1}{6}P_{n-2}+\frac{1}{6}P_{n-3}+\frac{1}{6}P_{n-4}+\frac{1}{6}P_{n-5}+\frac{1}{6}P_{n-6} \\ &= \frac{1}{6} \left( P_{n-1}+P_{n-2}+P_{n-3}+P_{n-4}+P_{n-5}+P_{n-6} \right) \end{align*}
Note that $P_1=P_2=0$ since it is impossible for the running total to be $1$ or $2$ after an even number of rolls.
Using the recursion, we can build a table of values for $P_0, P_3, P_4, P_5, P_6:$
\[\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c} & & & & & \\ [-2.25ex] \boldsymbol{x} & \boldsymbol{P_0} & \boldsymbol{P_3} & \boldsymbol{P_4} & \boldsymbol{P_5} & \boldsymbol{P_6} \\ [0.5ex] \hline & & & & & \\ [-2ex] 0 & 1 & \frac{1}{6} & \frac{7}{216} & \frac{49}{1296} & \frac{343}{7776} \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{36} & \frac{7}{216} & \frac{49}{1296} \\ 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{36} & \frac{7}{216} \\ 3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{36} \\ 4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 6 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array}\]
Thus, $P_3=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } \frac{49}{216}}.$

Model Final Answer #4: abstain
Model Answer #4: Let $P_n$ denote the probability that Janet's running total equals $n$ after $4$ rolls. We wish to find $P_3.$ We notice that $P_3=0,$ $P_0=\frac{1}{6^4}=\frac{1}{1296},$ and $P_1=P_2=0$ because it is impossible to reach a sum of $1$ or $2$ in $4$ rolls. Now, we look at the probability of reaching a certain number $n$ given that the running total after $3$ rolls is $n-1,$ $n,$ or $n+1:$
\begin{align*} P_n&=\frac{1}{6}P_{n-1}+\frac{1}{6}P_n+\frac{1}{6}P_{n+1} \\ &=\frac{1}{6}(P_{n-1}+P_n+P_{n+1}). \end{align*}
We build a table:
\[\begin{array}{|r||r|r|r|r|r|r|} \hline n & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline P_n & \frac{1}{1296} & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{6}(P_2+P_3+P_4) & 0 & 0 \\ \hline \end{array}\]
We see that $P_3=\frac{1}{6}(P_2+P_3+P_4).$ We can find $P_4$ in terms of $P_3$ and $P_2:$
\begin{align*} P_4&=\frac{1}{6}(P_3+P_4+P_5) \\ &=\frac{1}{6}[P_3+(P_2+P_3+P_4)+P_5] \\ &=\frac{1}{6}(2P_3+P_2+P_5). \end{align*}
We can find $P_5$ in terms of $P_4$ and $P_3:$
\begin{align*} P_5&=\frac{1}{6}(P_4+P_5+P_6) \\ &=\frac{1}{6}[P_4+(P_3+P_4+P_5)+P_6] \\ &=\frac{1}{6}(2P_4+P_3+P_6). \end{align*}
We can find $P_6$ in terms of $P_5$ and $P_4:$
\begin{align*} P_6&=\frac{1}{6}(P_5+P_6+P_7) \\ &=\frac{1}{6}[P_5+(P_4+P_5+P_6)+P_7] \\ &=\frac{1}{6}(2P_5+P_4+P_7). \end{align*}
It seems we have reached a standstill. However, notice that $P_7=0$ because it is impossible to reach a running total of $7$ in $4$ rolls. We can substitute our expressions for $P_4,$ $P_5,$ and $P_6$ in terms of $P_3$ and $P_2$ to get
\[P_6=\frac{1}{6}\left(2\left[\frac{1}{6}(2P_3+P_2+P_5)\right]+P_3\right).\]
Substituting our expression for $P_5,$ we get
\begin{align*} P_6&=\frac{1}{6}\left(2\left[\frac{1}{6}\left(2P_3+P_2+\frac{1}{6}(2P_4+P_3+P_6)\right)\right]+P_3\right) \\ &=\frac{1}{6}\left(\frac{1}{3}P_3+\frac{1}{3}P_2+\frac{1}{6}P_4\right)+\frac{1}{6}P_3 \\ &=\frac{1}{18}P_3+\frac{1}{18}P_2+\frac{1}{36}P_4+\frac{1}{6}P_3 \\ &=\frac{7}{36}P_3+\frac{1}{18}P_2+\frac{1}{36}P_4. \end{align*}
Substituting our expression for $P_4,$ we get

We notice that if we get infinitely many more terms, the numerator of the term with $P_4$ will become $-\infty,$ the numerator of the term with $P_2$ will become $-\infty,$ and the numerator of the term with $P_3$ will become $+\infty.$ This means that we can ignore all the other terms except for the terms with $P_4,$ $P_3,$ and $P_2.$ We can set up an equation:
\begin{align*} P_6&=\frac{7}{36}P_3+\frac{1}{18}P_2+\frac{1}{36}P_4 \\ P_5&=\frac{7}{36}P_4+\frac{1}{18}P_3+\frac{1}{36}P_5 \\ P_4&=\frac{7}{36}P_5+\frac{1}{18}P_4+\frac{1}{36}P_6. \end{align*}
We can solve the system of equations. We have
\begin{align*} P_6-\frac{1}{36}P_4-\frac{7}{36}P_3&=\frac{1}{18}P_2 \\ P_5-\frac{1}{36}P_5-\frac{7}{36}P_4&=\frac{1}{18}P_3 \\ P_4-\frac{1}{36}P_6-\frac{7}{36}P_5&=\frac{1}{18}P_4. \end{align*}
We can substitute $P_4-\frac{1}{36}P_6-\frac{7}{36}P_5=\frac{1}{18}P_4$ into the other equations to get
\begin{align*} P_6-\frac{1}{36}P_4-\frac{7}{36}P_3&=\frac{1}{18}P_2 \\ P_5-\frac{1}{36}P_5-\frac{7}{36}P_4&=\frac{1}{18}P_3 \\ \frac{1}{18}P_4&=\frac{1}{18}P_4. \end{align*}
We have $P_6-\frac{1}{36}P_4-\frac{7}{36}P_3=\frac{1}{18}P_2,$ which simplifies to
\[P_6-\frac{1}{6}P_4-\frac{7}{6}P_3=\frac{1}{3}P_2.\]
We have $P_5-\frac{1}{36}P_5-\frac{7}{36}P_4=\frac{1}{18}P_3,$ which simplifies to
\[P_5-\frac{1}{6}P_5-\frac{7}{6}P_4=\frac{1}{3}P_3.\]
We have $\frac{1}{18}P_4=\frac{1}{18}P_4.$ Thus, we have the following system of equations:
\begin{align*} P_6-\frac{1}{6}P_4-\frac{7}{6}P_3&=\frac{1}{3}P_2 \\ P_5-\frac{1}{6}P_5-\frac{7}{6}P_4&=\frac{1}{3}P_3 \\ \frac{1}{18}P_4&=\frac{1}{18}P_4. \end{align*}
We can solve the system of equations. We have
\begin{align*} P_6&=\frac{1}{6}P_4+\frac{7}{6}P_3+\frac{1}{3}P_2 \\ P_5&=\frac{1}{6}P_5+\frac{7}{6}P_4+\frac{1}{3}P_3 \\ \frac{1}{18}P_4&=\frac{1}{18}P_4. \end{align*}
We can now substitute $P_5=\frac{1}{6}P_5+\frac{7}{6}P_4+\frac{1}{3}P_3$ into the equation $P_6=\frac{1}{6}P_4+\frac{7}{6}P_3+\frac{1}{3}P_2$ to get
\[P_6=\frac{1}{6}P_6+\frac{7}{6}P_5+\frac{1}{3}P_4+\frac{1}{3}P_2.\]
We can also substitute $P_6=\frac{1}{6}P_6+\frac{7}{6}P_5+\frac{1}{3}P_4+\frac{1}{3}P_2$ into the equation $P_5=\frac{1}{6}P_5+\frac{7}{6}P_4+\frac{1}{3}P_3$ to get

We can substitute $P_3=\frac{6}{7}P_5+\frac{1}{7}P_4$ into the equation $P_4=\frac{6}{25}P_5+\frac{5}{25}P_6+\frac{2}{25}P_2$ to get
\[P_4=\frac{6}{25}P_5+\frac{5}{25}P_6+\frac{2}{25}P_2.\]

Model Final Answer #5: E
Model Answer #5: Let $P_n$ be the probability that Janet reaches a total of $n$ after $4$ rolls.  We are trying to find $P_3$.  We know that $P_0 = 1$ (because if Janet has a total of $0$ after $4$ rolls, then she must have rolled $4$ zeros).  We also know that $P_n = \frac{1}{6} (P_{n-1} + P_{n-2} + P_{n-3} + P_{n-4} + P_{n-5} + P_{n-6})$ for $n \geq 1$, because after the first roll, the maximum total is $6$, so Janet's total after the first roll can be any number from $1$ to $6$, each with equal probability.  The only way she can reach a total of $n \geq 1$ after $4$ rolls is to roll a $1$ and then reach a total of $n-1$ in the next $3$ rolls, roll a $2$ and then reach a total of $n-2$ in the next $3$ rolls, etc.  (Note:  It is also possible to reach a total of $n$ after $4$ rolls by rolling a $3$ and then reaching a total of $n-3$ in the next $3$ rolls, but this is already accounted for in the formula since $P_3$ is included in this equation.)
Using this recursion, we find that $P_3 = \frac{13}{54}$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }\frac{13}{54}}$.

Model Final Answer #6: C
Model Answer #6: We can turn this problem into a recursion by letting $P_n$ be the probability that Janet's running total equals $3$ after $n$ rolls and $E_n, F_n, G_n$ be the probability that her running total equals $3$ after $n$ rolls given that her roll is $1, 2$ or $3$ respectively. We can calculate that $P_4 = E_3 + F_3 + G_3$.
If Janet rolls a $1$ on the first roll, then she needs a $2$ on the next three rolls to get a total of $3$. If Janet rolls a $2$ on the first roll, then she needs a $2$ on the next roll and needs a $1$ on one of the following two rolls to get a total of $3$. Finally, if Janet rolls a $3$ on the first roll, then she needs a $1$ on the next two rolls and a $2$ on the final roll to get a total of $3$. Therefore, $E_3 = \frac{1}{6}$ and $F_3 = G_3 = \frac{1}{36}$. Putting it all together, we get $P_4 = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{36} + \frac{1}{36} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } \frac{25}{108}}$.

Model Final Answer #7: A
Model Answer #7: We solve this problem using recursion. Let $P(N)$ be the probability that her running total equals $3$ after $N$ rolls. Clearly, $P(0) = 0.$
For $N > 0,$ we can express $P(N)$ in terms of $P(N-1):$ \[P(N) = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \left( P(N-1) + P(N-1) + P(N-1) + P(N-1) + P(N-1) + P(N-1) \right) = \frac{6}{6} \cdot P(N-1).\]Thus, we have $P(N) = P(N-1)$ for all $N > 0.$ Since $P(0) = 0,$ $P(N) = P(0) = \boxed{\textbf{(A) } \frac{2}{9}}$ for all $N > 0.$

Model Final Answer #8: B
Model Answer #8: We can solve this problem using states. Let $P_n$ be the probability that her running total will equal $3$ after rolling $n$ times.
Note that $P_0 = 0$. 
When we roll the die, we can add $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ or $6$ to the running total. Thus, 
\[P_n = \frac{P_{n-1} + P_{n-2} + P_{n-3} + P_{n-4} + P_{n-5} + P_{n-6}}{6}.\]
Now, we can compute $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ to get our answer.
We see that $P_1 = 0,$ $P_2 = 0,$ $P_3 = \frac{1}{6},$ $P_4 = \frac{1}{36},$ and $P_5 = \frac{1}{216}.$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{49}{216}}.$

Model Final Answer #9: A
Model Answer #9: As in Solution 1, we can solve this problem using recursion. Let $P(n, m)$ be the probability that the running total is $n$ after $m$ rolls. We want to find $P(3, 4)$. 
Let's consider the last roll that Janet makes. If the last roll is $1$, then Janet will have a running total of $n-1$ after $m-1$ rolls. Similarly, if the last roll is $2$, then Janet will have a running total of $n-2$ after $m-1$ rolls. We can continue this logic with the other numbers $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$ to get a recursion: \[P(n, m) = \frac{1}{6}P(n-1, m-1) + \frac{1}{6}P(n-2, m-1) + \ldots + \frac{1}{6}P(n-6, m-1)\]
Note that the base cases are \[P(n, 1) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } n = 0, \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}. \end{cases}\] Now, we can recursively compute $P(3, 4)$. Using the recursion, we have \begin{align*} P(3, 4) &= \frac{1}{6}P(2, 3) + \frac{1}{6}P(1, 3) + \frac{1}{6}P(0, 3) + \frac{1}{6}P(-1, 3) + \frac{1}{6}P(-2, 3) + \frac{1}{6}P(-3, 3) \\ &= \frac{1}{6}P(2, 3) + \frac{1}{6}P(1, 3) + \frac{1}{6}P(0, 3) \\ &= \frac{1}{6}P(1, 2) + \frac{1}{6}P(0, 2) + \frac{1}{6}P(-1, 2) + \frac{1}{6}P(0, 2) + \frac{1}{6}P(-1, 2) + \frac{1}{6}P(-2, 2) \\ &= \frac{1}{6}P(1, 2) + \frac{2}{6}P(0, 2) + \frac{2}{6}P(-1, 2) + \frac{1}{6}P(-2, 2) \\ &= \frac{1}{6}P(0, 1) + \frac{2}{6}P(-1, 1) + \frac{3}{6}P(-2, 1) + \frac{2}{6}P(-1, 1) + \frac{1}{6}P(-2, 1) \\ &= \frac{1}{6}P(0, 1) + \frac{3}{6}P(-1, 1) + \frac{3}{6}P(-2, 1) \\ &= \frac{1}{6} + \frac{3}{6}P(-1, 1) + \frac{3}{6}P(-2, 1) \\ &= \frac{1}{6} + \frac{3}{6}P(0, 0) + \frac{3}{6}P(-1, 0) \\ &= \frac{1}{6} + \frac{3}{6} + \frac{3}{6}P(-1, 0) \\ &= \frac{2}{3} + \frac{3}{6}P(-1, 0) \\ &= \frac{2}{3} + \frac{3}{6}(0) \\ &= \boxed{\textbf{(A)} \frac{2}{9}}. \end{align*}

Model Final Answer #10: D
Model Answer #10: Let $P_{i}$ be the probability that the running total is $i$ after $4$ rolls. We want to find the sum $P_{3}+P_{9}+P_{15}+P_{21} + \cdots +P_{21}$ (since it's easy to see that $P_{n}=0$ for all other values of $n$).
We note that $P_{n}$ can be expressed as the sum of $P_{n-1},P_{n-2},P_{n-3},P_{n-4},P_{n-5},$ and $P_{n-6}$, each divided by $6$, since rolling a $1,2,3,4,5,$ or $6$ will only change the value of the running total by $1,2,3,4,5,$ or $6$, respectively.
Therefore, we have the following system of equations: \begin{align*}
P_{3} &= \frac{P_{2} + P_{1} + P_{0} + P_{-1} + P_{-2} + P_{-3}}{6} \\
P_{9} &= \frac{P_{8} + P_{7} + P_{6} + P_{5} + P_{4} + P_{3}}{6} \\
P_{15} &= \frac{P_{14} + P_{13} + P_{12} + P_{11} + P_{10} + P_{9}}{6} \\
&\,\,\vdots \\
P_{21} &= \frac{P_{20} + P_{19} + P_{18} + P_{17} + P_{16} + P_{15}}{6}
\end{align*} Summing these equations gives \[P_{3} + P_{9} + P_{15} + \cdots + P_{21} = \frac{1}{6}(P_{2} + P_{1} + P_{0} + P_{-1} + P_{-2} + P_{-3}) + \frac{1}{6}(P_{8} + P_{7} + P_{6} + P_{5} + P_{4} + P_{3}) + \cdots + \frac{1}{6}(P_{20} + P_{19} + P_{18} + P_{17} + P_{16} + P_{15})\] Notice that all terms on the RHS cancel out except for $P_{2}$ and $P_{-3}$. Therefore, we have $P_{3} + P_{9} + P_{15} + \cdots + P_{21} = \frac{1}{6}(P_{2} + P_{-3})$. We rewrite this equation as $6(P_{3} + P_{9} + P_{15} + \cdots + P_{21}) = P_{2} + P_{-3}$.
We solve for $P_{3} + P_{9} + P_{15} + \cdots + P_{21}$ by solving for $P_{2}$ and $P_{-3}$. We get that $P_{2} = \frac{1}{6}(P_{1} + P_{0} + P_{-1} + P_{-2} + P_{-3} + P_{-4})$, and $P_{-3} = \frac{1}{6}(P_{-4} + P_{-5} + P_{-6} + P_{-7} + P_{-8} + P_{-9})$. We plug this into the equation $6(P_{3} + P_{9} + P_{15} + \cdots + P_{21}) = P_{2} + P_{-3}$ to get \[6(P_{3} + P_{9} + P_{15} + \cdots + P_{21}) = \frac{1}{6}(P_{1} + P_{0} + P_{-1} + P_{-2} + P_{-3} + P_{-4}) + \frac{1}{6}(P_{-4} + P_{-5} + P_{-6} + P_{-7} + P_{-8} + P_{-9})\] We multiply both sides by $6$ to get $36(P_{3} + P_{9} + P_{15} + \cdots + P_{21}) = P_{1} + P_{0} + P_{-1} + \cdots + P_{-9}$.
We solve for the RHS by noting that it is equal to $1 - P_{10}$. We have $P_{10} = \frac{P_{9} + P_{8} + P_{7} + P_{6} + P_{5} + P_{4}}{6}$, and $P_{9} = \frac{P_{8} + P_{7} + P_{6} + P_{5} + P_{4} + P_{3}}{6}$, so $P_{10} = \frac{P_{9} + P_{8} + P_{7} + P_{6} + P_{5} + P_{4}}{6} = \frac{7P_{9} + P_{3}}{6}$. We solve for $P_{9}$ in the equation $P_{9} = \frac{P_{8} + P_{7} + P_{6} + P_{5} + P_{4} + P_{3}}{6}$ to get $P_{9} = \frac{P_{8} + P_{7} + P_{6} + P_{5} + P_{4} + \frac{P_{9} + P_{8} + P_{7} + P_{6} + P_{5} + P_{4}}{6}}{6}$. We find a common denominator to get $P_{9} = \frac{6P_{8} + 6P_{7} + 6P_{6} + 6P_{5} + 6P_{4} + P_{9} + P_{8} + P_{7} + P_{6} + P_{5} + P_{4}}{36}$. We move all terms with $P_{9}$ to the left-hand side to get $\frac{35P_{9}}{36} = \frac{6P_{8} + 6P_{7} + 6P_{6} + 6P_{5} + 6P_{4}}{36}$. We multiply both sides by $36$ to get $35P_{9} = 6P_{8} + 6P_{7} + 6P_{6} + 6P_{5} + 6P_{4}$, so $P_{9} = \frac{6P_{8} + 6P_{7} + 6P_{6} + 6P_{5} + 6P_{4}}{35}$. We plug this into the equation $P_{10} = \frac{7P_{9} + P_{3}}{6}$ to get $P_{10} = \frac{7\left(\frac{6P_{8} + 6P_{7} + 6P_{6} + 6P_{5} + 6P_{4}}{35}\right) + P_{3}}{6}$. We simplify to get $P_{10} = \frac{36P_{8} + 36P_{7} + 36P_{6} + 36P_{5} + 36P_{4} + 35P_{3}}{210}$.
We note that all terms on the RHS cancel out except for $P_{3}$. Therefore, we have $P_{10} = \frac{35P_{3}}{210}$. We rewrite this as $210P_{10} = 35P_{3}$.
We plug this into the equation $36(P_{3} + P_{9} + P_{15} + \cdots + P_{21}) = P_{1} + P_{0} + P_{-1} + \cdots + P_{-9}$ to get \[36(P_{3} + P_{9} + P_{15} + \cdots + P_{21}) = 1 - P_{10}.\] We plug in $210P_{10} = 35P_{3}$ to get \[36(P_{3} + P_{9} + P_{15} + \cdots + P_{21}) = 1 - \frac{35P_{3}}{210}.\] We multiply both sides by $210$ to get \[7560(P_{3} + P_{9} + P_{15} + \cdots + P_{21}) = 210 - 35P_{3}.\] We move all terms with $P_{3}$ to the left-hand side to get \[7560P_{3} + 35P_{3} = 210.\] We combine like terms to get \[7595P_{3} = 210.\] We solve for $P_{3}$ to get \[P_{3} = \frac{42}{1519}.\] Therefore, the answer is $P_{3} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }\frac{17}{72}}$.

8) Barb the baker has developed a new temperature scale for her bakery called the Breadus scale, which is a linear function of the Fahrenheit scale. Bread rises at $110$ degrees Fahrenheit, which is $0$ degrees on the Breadus scale. Bread is baked at $350$ degrees Fahrenheit, which is $100$ degrees on the Breadus scale. Bread is done when its internal temperature is $200$ degrees Fahrenheit. What is this, in degrees, on the Breadus scale? $A) 33 B) 34.5 C) 36 D) 37.5 E) 39$
Solution: D
Model Final Answer #1: D
Model Answer #1: We can start by finding the slope of the linear function using two points: $(0, 110)$ and $(100, 350)$. The slope is $\frac{350-110}{100-0} = 2.4$. We now have the equation of the line in slope-intercept form: $y = 2.4x + b$, where $x$ is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and $y$ is the temperature in degrees on the Breadus scale. We can plug in the point $(100, 350)$ to solve for $b$: $350 = 2.4(100) + b \Rightarrow b = 350 - 240 = 110$. Thus, the equation of the line is $y = 2.4x + 110$. To find the temperature on the Breadus scale when the internal temperature is $200$ degrees Fahrenheit, we substitute $x = 200$ into the equation: $y = 2.4(200) + 110 = 480 + 110 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 37.5}$.

We are given two points on the line: $(110,0)$ and $(350,100)$. The slope is $\frac{100-0}{350-110} = \frac{10}{24} = \frac{5}{12}$, so the equation of the line is $y = \frac{5}{12}x + b$. Substituting the point $(110,0)$ gives us $0 = \frac{5}{12} \cdot 110 + b$, so $b = -\frac{275}{3}$. Thus, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{5}{12}x - \frac{275}{3}$.

We want to find the Breadus temperature when the Fahrenheit temperature is $200$. Substituting $200$ into the equation gives us $y = \frac{5}{12} \cdot 200 - \frac{275}{3} = 36$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 36}$.

Model Final Answer #3: B
Model Answer #3: We can see that $200$ degrees Fahrenheit is $\frac{200}{350-110}\cdot100=50$ degrees Breadus.
The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 34.5}$.

Model Final Answer #4: A
Model Answer #4: Since the Breadus scale is linear, we can set up a proportion. Since $110$ degrees on the Fahrenheit scale is $0$ degrees on the Breadus scale and $350$ degrees on the Fahrenheit scale is $100$ degrees on the Breadus scale, we have the proportion $\frac{110}{350} = \frac{0}{x}$, where $x$ is the number of degrees in the Breadus scale. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=\boxed{33}$.

Model Final Answer #5: D
Model Answer #5: First, we need to find the slope of the linear function that converts Fahrenheit to Breadus. We are given that $110$ degrees Fahrenheit is equal to $0$ degrees on the Breadus scale, and $350$ degrees Fahrenheit is equal to $100$ degrees on the Breadus scale. We can set up the equation $0=110m+b$ and $100=350m+b$ where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. Subtracting the first equation from the second one gives $100=240m$, so $m=\frac{5}{12}$. We need to find the Breadus equivalent of $200$ degrees Fahrenheit, which we can call $x$. Substituting this into the original equation, we have $x=200m+b$, or $x=\frac{5}{12}(200)+b$. We can substitute $m=\frac{5}{12}$ and $b=0$ into this equation and simplify to get $x=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 37.5}$.

Model Final Answer #6: C
Model Answer #6: We start by finding the equation for the Breadus scale in terms of the Fahrenheit scale. Let $B$ be the temperature on the Breadus scale and $F$ be the temperature on the Fahrenheit scale. We want to find a linear function $B = mF + b$ that satisfies the given conditions. Substituting $(F,B) = (110, 0)$, we get $0 = 110m + b$. Substituting $(F,B) = (350, 100)$, we get $100 = 350m + b$. Subtracting these two equations, we get $100 = 240m$, so $m = \frac{5}{12}$. Substituting this into the equation $0 = 110m + b$, we get $0 = 110\left(\frac{5}{12}\right) + b$, so $b = -\frac{275}{6}$. Therefore, the equation for the Breadus scale in terms of the Fahrenheit scale is $B = \frac{5}{12}F -\frac{275}{6}$. 
We want to find the value of $B$ when $F = 200$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $B = \frac{5}{12}(200) -\frac{275}{6} = \frac{1000}{12} -\frac{275}{6} = \frac{500}{6} -\frac{275}{6} = \frac{225}{6} = \frac{75}{2} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 36}$.

Model Final Answer #7: B
Model Answer #7: Let $x$ be the temperature on the Breadus scale. We know that $110$ degrees Fahrenheit is $0$ degrees on the Breadus scale and $350$ degrees Fahrenheit is $100$ degrees on the Breadus scale. This gives us two points on the line, $(0,110)$ and $(100,350)$. Using the two-point form of a linear equation, we can find the equation of the line: \begin{align*}
y-y_1 &= \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}(x-x_1)\\
y-110 &= \frac{350-110}{100-0}(x-0)\\
y-110 &= \frac{240}{100}x\\
y &= \frac{12}{5}x+110.
\end{align*}We want to find the value of $x$ when $y=200$. Substituting, we get $200=\frac{12}{5}x+110$. Solving for $x$, we find $x=\boxed{34.5}$.

Model Final Answer #8: abstain
Model Answer #8: We can start by finding the equation of the linear function. Since $0^\circ$ Fahrenheit $= 110^\circ$ Breadus and $100^\circ$ Fahrenheit $= 350^\circ$ Breadus, we know that the slope of the linear function is $\frac{350-110}{100-0} = \frac{240}{100} = 2.4$. Also, since $110^\circ$ Fahrenheit $= 0^\circ$ Breadus, the equation can be written as $y = 2.4x - 0$, or $y = 2.4x$.
We want to find the value of $x$ when $y = 200$. Plugging this into the equation gives us $200 = 2.4x$, which means $x = \frac{200}{2.4} = \boxed{83.33}$.
Note: The point $(0, 0)$ is completely unnecessary in this problem and could be removed.

Model Final Answer #9: D
Model Answer #9: To get the equation of the line, we use the two given points: $(110,0)$ and $(350,100)$. We find that the slope of the line is $\frac{100-0}{350-110} = \frac{100}{240} = \frac{5}{12}$. Now we have the equation $y=\frac{5}{12}x+b$. Plugging in $(110,0)$ into our equation gives us $0=\frac{5}{12}(110)+b$, or $b=-\frac{275}{6}$. Thus, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{5}{12}x - \frac{275}{6}$.
Plugging in $200$ into this equation gives us $y=\frac{5}{12}(200)-\frac{275}{6} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }37.5}$.

----

Model Final Answer #10: D
Model Answer #10: We first find the linear equation for the Breadus scale. The two points $(0, 110)$ and $(100, 350)$ are on the line, so the slope is $(350-110)/(100-0)=\frac{240}{100}=2.4$. We plug $(0,110)$ into the form $y=2.4x+b$ to find $b$ and get $110=0+b$, so $b=110$. Thus, the equation is $y=2.4x+110$.

Next, we plug in $200$ for $y$ and solve for $x$: \begin{align*}
200&=2.4x+110\\
90&=2.4x\\
37.5&=x
\end{align*} The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 37.5}$.

9) A digital display shows the current date as an $8$-digit integer consisting of a $4$-digit year, followed by a $2$-digit month, followed by a $2$-digit date within the month. For example, Arbor Day this year is displayed as $20230428.$ For how many dates in $2023$ does each digit appear an even number of times in the $8$-digital display for that date? $A) 5 B)6 C)7 D)8 E)9$
Solution: E
Model Final Answer #1: E
Model Answer #1: Note that each date must have an even number of digits in order for all digits to appear an even number of times. 
Since each month has a different number of days, we must analyze each month separately. 
The dates of January are $01$ through $31$, so the even digits are $0, 1, 2, 3$. 
The dates of February are $01$ through $28$, so the even digits are $0, 1, 2$. 
The dates of March are $01$ through $31$, so the even digits are $0, 1, 2, 3$. 
The dates of April are $01$ through $30$, so the even digits are $0, 1, 2, 3$. 
The dates of May are $01$ through $31$, so the even digits are $0, 1, 2, 3$. 
The dates of June are $01$ through $30$, so the even digits are $0, 1, 2, 3$. 
The dates of July are $01$ through $31$, so the even digits are $0, 1, 2, 3$. 
The dates of August are $01$ through $31$, so the even digits are $0, 1, 2, 3$. 
The dates of September are $01$ through $30$, so the even digits are $0, 1, 2, 3$. 
The dates of October are $01$ through $31$, so the even digits are $0, 1, 2, 3$. 
The dates of November are $01$ through $30$, so the even digits are $0, 1, 2, 3$. 
The dates of December are $01$ through $31$, so the even digits are $0, 1, 2, 3$. 
Therefore, the answer is $4 + 3 \times 4 = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }9}$.

Model Final Answer #2: A
Model Answer #2: The digital display has $10$ possible digits, $0, 1, \dots, 9$. Therefore, for each digit to appear an even number of times, it must appear $0$ or $2$ times since it is an $8$-digit number.
We now consider the year $2023$. There are $10$ possible digits to fill in the $8$ digits, and the first digit cannot be $0$. Thus, we have $10^7$ possible ways to fill in the digits.
First, we consider the number of ways to fill in the digits so that $0$ appears an even number of times. Now, we consider cases:
Case $1$: $0$ appears $0$ times
We have $9$ possible digits to fill in the first digit, and $10^6$ possible ways to fill in the other $6$ digits. Thus, we have $9 \cdot 10^6$ total ways.
Case $2$: $0$ appears $2$ times
We have $9$ possible digits to fill in the first digit, $9$ possible digits to fill in the second digit, and $10^5$ possible digits to fill in the other $5$ digits. Thus, we have $9 \cdot 9 \cdot 10^5$ total ways.
Thus, the total number of ways to fill in the digits such that $0$ appears an even number of times is $9 \cdot 10^6 + 9 \cdot 9 \cdot 10^5 = 9 \cdot 10^5(10 + 9) = 9 \cdot 10^5 \cdot 19$.
We can apply the same reasoning for the other $9$ digits. Thus, the total number of ways to fill in the digits so that each digit appears an even number of times is $9 \cdot 10^5 \cdot 19 \cdot 10 = 171 \cdot 10^6 = 171,000,000$.
The total number of days in $2023$ is $365$, so the answer is $\frac{171,000,000}{365} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(A) } 5}$.

Model Final Answer #3: C
Model Answer #3: We proceed by casework on the number of digits which appear twice. Note that a digit can only appear twice if the other digit in its pair is also present.
$\textbf{Case 1:}$ No digits appear twice.
In this case, we have $10$ choices for the digit which appears twice. After it is chosen, we have $8$ choices for where to put the digits, then $7$ choices, and so on. Therefore, there are $10\cdot8!$ such dates.
$\textbf{Case 2:}$ Two digits appear twice.
We have $10$ choices for the first digit, then $9$ choices for the second digit. After they are chosen, we have $\binom{8}{4}$ ways to place the digits. Therefore, there are $10\cdot9\cdot\binom{8}{4}$ such dates.
$\textbf{Case 3:}$ Four digits appear twice.
We have $10$ choices for the first digit, then $9$ choices for the second digit, and so on. After they are chosen, we have $\binom{8}{2}\binom{6}{2}$ ways to place the digits. Therefore, there are $10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot\binom{8}{2}\binom{6}{2}$ such dates.
$\textbf{Case 4:}$ Six digits appear twice.
The six digits must be chosen from the numbers from $0$ to $9$. If no even digit is chosen, there are $1$ ways to choose them. If one even digit is chosen, there are $\binom{5}{1}$ ways to choose it and $6^2$ ways to choose the other two digits. If two even digits are chosen, there are $\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose them and $6$ ways to choose the other two digits. If three even digits are chosen, there are $\binom{5}{3}$ ways to choose them and $2$ ways to choose the other two digits. If four even digits are chosen, there are $\binom{5}{4}$ ways to choose them. Thus, there are $1+\binom{5}{1}\cdot6^2+\binom{5}{2}\cdot6+\binom{5}{3}\cdot2+\binom{5}{4}$ ways to choose the digits. After they are chosen, there is $1$ way to choose where to place the digits. Therefore, there are $1+\binom{5}{1}\cdot6^2+\binom{5}{2}\cdot6+\binom{5}{3}\cdot2+\binom{5}{4}$ such dates.
$\textbf{Case 5:}$ Eight digits appear twice.
There is one way to pick the digits and one way to place the digits. Therefore, there is only one such date.
In total, we have $10\cdot8!+10\cdot9\cdot\binom{8}{4}+10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot\binom{8}{2}\binom{6}{2}+1+\binom{5}{1}\cdot6^2+\binom{5}{2}\cdot6+\binom{5}{3}\cdot2+\binom{5}{4}=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }7}$ ways.

Model Final Answer #4: D
Model Answer #4: The $2$-digit date within the month can be represented as $AB$ where $A$ and $B$ are digits. If $A$ is even, then $B$ must be odd and vice-versa. In other words, the parity of $A$ and $B$ must be opposite.
$B$ has $10$ possibilities ($0$ to $9$) so $A$ has $5$ possibilities. This gives $5 \cdot 12 \cdot 10$ possibilities.
However, the year is $2023$, not $2020$, so there are $365$ days in the year, not $366$ days. This means $0229$ is not a valid date. The answer is $5 \cdot 12 \cdot 10 - 1 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 8}.$
Note: To prove that $B$ has $10$ possibilities, you can note that $B$ cannot be $0$ because if $B = 0$, then the digit $0$ will appear an odd number of times.

Model Final Answer #5: D
Model Answer #5: We can clearly see that the year part does not change the amount of times a digit appears. So we don't need to care about that.
For the month part: for each digit, it appears in $5$ months out of the $12$ months. So, the total amount of months is $12 \cdot 5 = 60$. 
For the day part: we analyze the first and second digit of the day separately.
For the first digit: for $0$, it appears $9$ times, for $1, 2$, it appears $20$ times, for $3, 4$, it appears $11$ times, for $5, 6$, it appears $9$ times, for $7, 8, 9$, it appears $10$ times. So, the total amount of first digits is $9 + 2 \cdot 20 + 2 \cdot 11 + 2 \cdot 9 + 3 \cdot 10 = 109$. 
For the second digit: for $0$, it appears $9$ times, for $1$, it appears $20$ times, for $2$, it appears $10$ times, for $3$, it appears $10$ times, for $4$, it appears $11$ times, for $5$, it appears $11$ times, for $6$, it appears $9$ times, for $7$, it appears $11$ times, for $8$, it appears $9$ times, for $9$, it appears $10$ times. So, the total amount of second digits is $9 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 11 + 11 + 9 + 11 + 9 + 10 = 110$.
So, the answer is $60 + 109 + 110 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }8}$.

Model Final Answer #6: E
Model Answer #6: Let the year be $20xy$.  Then we must have:
\[2+2+2+x+y = 2(1+2+3+x+y)+4 = 16+2(x+y) \equiv 0 \pmod{8}.\]
We can test this with $x+y=0,1,2,\dots,9$.  We quickly find that the only solutions are $x+y=4,8$.  If $x+y=4$, then $x+y=0$ in $\pmod{4}$, so $xy$ is divisible by $4$.  If $x+y=8$, then $x+y=0$ in $\pmod{8}$, so $xy$ is divisible by $8$.  We can list out the possible values of $(x,y)$:
\[(1,3), (2,6), (3,1), (4,5), (5,0), (6,2), (7,7), (8,4), (9,9).\]
Each of these gives us one solution, for a total of $\boxed{9}$.

Model Final Answer #7: D
Model Answer #7: Let's start with the year part of the date. We can have $0,1,2,3$ digits of the number be odd. If $0$ digits are odd, there is $1$ possible year. If $1$ digit is odd, there are ${4\choose1} \cdot 5 = 20$ possible years. If $2$ digits are odd, there are ${4\choose2} \cdot 5^2=200$ possible years. If $3$ digits are odd, there are ${4\choose3} \cdot 5^3 = 500$ possible years. If all $4$ digits are odd, there are $625$ possible years. This gives us a total of $1+20+200+500+625= \boxed{\textbf{(D) }8}$ possible years.
Now we move on to the month part of the date. The month can range from $01$ to $12$, so we have $2,3$ digits to work with. The number of ways for each digit to show up an even number of times can be computed using PIE.
$2$ digits: There are $10$ possible even pairs of digits, so there are $10^2 = 100$ possible months.
$3$ digits: Using PIE, we get $100 - \binom{2}{1} \cdot 9 + \binom{2}{2} \cdot 8 = 91$ possible months.
So there are $100+91 = 191$ possible months.
Finally, we move on to the day part of the date. We have $2$ digits to work with. The number of ways for each digit to show up an even number of times can also be computed using PIE.
$2$ digits: There are $10$ possible even pairs of digits, so there are $10^2 = 100$ possible days.
So there are $100$ possible days.
Multiplying our three numbers, we get $8$ possible dates, thus our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }8}$

Model Final Answer #8: D
Model Answer #8: We can start by breaking down the problem into multiple cases.
Case $1$: There is $1$ number that appears an odd number of times.
There are $10$ possibilities for each spot (except for the $7$th spot), so there are $10^7$ ways to assign the digits. We must subtract the cases where a digit appears an odd number of times. There are $10$ choices for which digit appears an odd number of times, and $9^7$ ways to assign each of the other digits. So, the total number of possibilities is $10^7-10\cdot9^7$.
Case $2$: There are $2$ numbers that appear an odd number of times.
We must choose $2$ of the spots to be odd, which can be done in $\binom{8}{2}=28$ ways. There are $10$ choices for which digits appear in the odd slots, and $9$ choices for which digits appear in the even slots. So, the total number of possibilities is $28\cdot10\cdot9^6$.
Case $3$: There are $3$ numbers that appear an odd number of times.
We must choose $3$ of the spots to be odd, which can be done in $\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways. There are $10$ choices for which digits appear in the odd slots, and $9^3$ choices for which digits appear in the even slots. So, the total number of possibilities is $56\cdot10\cdot9^3$.
Case $4$: There are $4$ numbers that appear an odd number of times.
We must choose $4$ of the spots to be odd, which can be done in $\binom{8}{4}=70$ ways. There are $10$ choices for which digits appear in the odd slots, and $9^2$ choices for which digits appear in the even slots. So, the total number of possibilities is $70\cdot10\cdot9^2$.
Case $5$: There are $5$ numbers that appear an odd number of times.
We must choose $5$ of the spots to be odd, which can be done in $\binom{8}{5}=56$ ways. There are $10$ choices for which digits appear in the odd slots, and $9$ choices for which digits appear in the even slots. So, the total number of possibilities is $56\cdot10\cdot9$.
Case $6$: There are $6$ numbers that appear an odd number of times.
We must choose $6$ of the spots to be odd, which can be done in $\binom{8}{6}=28$ ways. There are $10$ choices for which digits appear in the odd slots, and $9$ choices for which digits appear in the even slots. So, the total number of possibilities is $28\cdot10\cdot9$.
Case $7$: There are $7$ numbers that appear an odd number of times.
There are $8$ choices for which digit appears an odd number of times, and $10$ choices for which digits appear in the even slots. So, the total number of possibilities is $8\cdot10$.
Case $8$: There are $8$ numbers that appear an odd number of times.
This case is the same as Case $1$.
Adding up all the cases, we get $10^7-10\cdot9^7+28\cdot10\cdot9^6+56\cdot10\cdot9^3+70\cdot10\cdot9^2+56\cdot10\cdot9+28\cdot10\cdot9+8\cdot10 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }8}$

Model Final Answer #9: C
Model Answer #9: This is equivalent to finding the number of eight-digit numbers $N$ (where $N \le 99991231$) such that the digit $D$ appears an even number of times. We consider the cases for $D = 0,1,\cdots,9$ separately.
Case 1: $D = 0$
There are $9$ choices for the leading digit, $9$ choices for the second digit, $9$ choices for the third digit, $9$ choices for the fourth digit, $9$ choices for the fifth digit, $9$ choices for the sixth digit, $9$ choices for the seventh digit, and $9$ choices for the eighth digit, for a total of $9^8$ such numbers.
Case 2: $D = 1$
There are $8$ choices for the leading digit (namely, $2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$), $9$ choices for the second digit, $9$ choices for the third digit, $9$ choices for the fourth digit, $9$ choices for the fifth digit, $9$ choices for the sixth digit, $9$ choices for the seventh digit, and $9$ choices for the eighth digit, for a total of $8 \cdot 9^7$ such numbers.
Case 3: $D = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$
There are $8$ choices for the leading digit (namely, $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$), $10$ choices for the second digit (since the digit $D$ is repeated), $9$ choices for the third digit, $9$ choices for the fourth digit, $9$ choices for the fifth digit, $9$ choices for the sixth digit, $9$ choices for the seventh digit, and $9$ choices for the eighth digit, for a total of $8 \cdot 10 \cdot 9^6$ such numbers.
Thus, the total number of such numbers is $9^8 + 8 \cdot 9^7 + 8 \cdot 10 \cdot 9^6 = 9^6 (9^2 + 8 \cdot 9 + 10) = 9^6 \cdot 791 = 9^6 \cdot 7 \cdot 113$, so the answer is $\boxed{7 \ \mathbf{(C)}}$.

Model Final Answer #10: D
Model Answer #10: Recall that an integer is divisible by $3$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $3.$ Note that since the digits on the display are fixed, the number of possible valid dates is just the number of even digit sums that are divisible by $3.$
Note that $2, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 2, 8$ has even digit sum of $21.$ Therefore, the number of dates in $2023$ such that the sum of its digits is even is equal to the number of times $21$ can be partitioned into non-negative multiples of $3.$
Let the number of times $21$ can be partitioned into non-negative multiples of $3$ be $n.$ Then, it follows that
$3a + 3b + 3c + 3d + 3e + 3f + 3g = 21$
$a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 7$
By the stars and bars argument, we see that there are a total of $\binom{7+7-1}{7-1} = \binom{13}{6} = 1716$ ways to partition $21$ into non-negative multiples of $3.$
Note that if we choose any $7$ of $a, b, c, d, e, f, g$ such that $0 \leq a, b, c, d, e, f, g \leq 5,$ then we will have assigned non-negative integers to $a, b, c, d, e, f, g$ and have $a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 7.$ There are $\binom{13}{6}$ ways to choose $a, b, c, d, e, f, g,$ so the number of ways to assign non-negative integers to $a, b, c, d, e, f, g$ is also $\binom{13}{6} = 1716.$
Recall that there are a total of $1716$ ways to partition $21$ into non-negative multiples of $3.$ However, we must reduce the total count because there are some ways to partition $21$ into non-negative multiples of $3$ that are not valid. Let's examine the cases where $a, b, c, d, e, f, g > 5.$
If $a > 5,$ then $a \geq 6.$ Therefore, we must subtract the number of ways for $a$ to be greater than $5.$ There are a total of $\binom{8+6-1}{6-1} = \binom{13}{5} = 1287$ ways for $a$ to be greater than $5.$ Similarly, there are a total of $\binom{13}{5}$ ways for $b, c, d, e, f, g$ to be greater than $5.$
To calculate the number of ways for $a, b, c, d, e, f, g$ to be greater than $5,$ we multiply the number of ways for $a$ to be greater than $5$ by the number of ways for $b, c, d, e, f, g$ to be greater than $5.$ Therefore, the number of ways for $a, b, c, d, e, f, g$ to be greater than $5$ is $\binom{13}{5}^2 = 1287^2.$
To sum up, the total number of ways to partition $21$ into non-negative multiples of $3$ is $1716 - 1287 - 1287^2.$
This means that the number of displays in $2023$ such that each digit appears an even number of times is $1716 - 1287 - 1287^2.$ However, notice that the problem is asking for the number of dates in $2023$ that have this property. We have to subtract the number of dates in $2023$ that do not have this property from the total number of dates in $2023,$ which is $365.$
The number of dates in $2023$ that do not have this property is $365 - (1716 - 1287 - 1287^2).$ We then have that the number of dates in $2023$ that have this property is $365 - (365 - (1716 - 1287 - 1287^2)) = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 8}.$

If she scores an $11$ on each of the next three quizzes, her mean will increase by $2$. What is the mean of her quiz scores currently? $A) 4 B) 5 C) 6 D) 7 E) 8$
Solution: D
Model Final Answer #1: E
Model Answer #1: Let her current mean be $m$, and let the current number of quizzes be $n$. Therefore, the sum of her current scores is $mn$. After scoring $11$ on the next quiz, the sum of her scores is $mn+11$, and the number of quizzes is $n+1$. Therefore, $\frac{mn+11}{n+1}=m+1$. After scoring $11$ on each of the next three quizzes, the sum of her scores is $mn+11+11+11+11$, and the number of quizzes is $n+3$. Therefore, $\frac{mn+44}{n+3}=m+2$. Cross-multiplying both equations gives us $mn+11=n(m+1)$ and $mn+44=(m+2)(n+3)$. Simplifying the first equation gives us $n=m+11$. Substituting this into the second equation gives us $m(m+11)+44=(m+2)(m+14)$. Expanding the right side and simplifying the left side gives us $m^2+11m+44=m^2+16m+28$. Simplifying gives us $5m=-16$, or $m=-\frac{16}{5}$. Since the mean cannot be negative, we get that the mean of her current quiz scores is $\boxed{8\textbf{(E)}}$.

Model Final Answer #2: E
Model Answer #2: Suppose Maureen has taken $x$ quizzes so far.  If Maureen scores an $11$ on the next quiz, her mean will increase by $1$, so the sum of her first $x$ scores is $x-1$.  If she scores an $11$ on each of the next three quizzes, her mean will increase by $2$, so the sum of the next $3$ quizzes is $6$.  Therefore, the sum of all her quizzes is $(x-1) + 3(11) = 33 + x - 1$, and since the mean is the sum divided by the number of quizzes, the mean is $\frac{33+x-1}{x} = \frac{32 + x}{x}$.  We are given that $\frac{32 + x}{x} = x + 2$, so $32 + x = x^2 + 2x$.  Rearranging, $x^2 + x - 32 = 0$.  Factoring, $(x+8)(x-4) =0$, so $x=-8$ or $x=4$.  We know that $x$ must be positive, so $x=4$, and the mean is $\frac{32 + 4}{4} = \boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 8}$.

Model Final Answer #3: C
Model Answer #3: Let $m$ be the sum of her scores on her current quizzes and let $n$ be the number of quizzes she has already taken. Then the mean of her quiz scores is $\frac{m}{n}$. After the next quiz, the mean of her quiz scores will be $\frac{m+11}{n+1}$, which is $1$ more than the previous mean. Therefore, we can set up the equation $\frac{m+11}{n+1}=\frac{m}{n}+1$. Cross-multiplying yields $mn=m+11n+11$, so $11n=m+11$. After the next three quizzes, the mean will be $\frac{m+11+11+11}{n+4}$, which is $2$ more than the previous mean. Therefore, we can set up another equation $\frac{m+33}{n+4}=\frac{m+11}{n}+2$. Cross-multiplying yields $mn+4m+44=mn+11n+2m+22$, so $9n+2m=22$. Solving this system of equations, we find that $m=6$ and $n=2$. Therefore, the mean of her quiz scores is $\frac{m}{n}=\frac{6}{2}=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 6}$.

Model Final Answer #4: D
Model Answer #4: Let $n$ be the number of quizzes taken so far.  Then the sum of her scores is $n$ times her current mean, so if she scores an 11 on the next quiz, her mean will increase to $\frac{n(n+1)}{n+1}=n,$ and if she scores an 11 on each of the next three quizzes, her mean will increase to $\frac{n(n+1)+6}{n+3}=n+2.$  Setting these two expressions for the mean equal, we get
\[n = n + 2,\]which means $2=0,$ contradiction.  Therefore, the mean of her quiz scores currently is $\boxed{7}.$

Model Final Answer #5: E
Model Answer #5: We will be using the formula for the mean. Let $x$ be the current mean of her quiz scores. Thus, we know that $\frac{x \cdot n + 11}{n+1} = x + 1$ and $\frac{x \cdot n + 11 \cdot 2}{n+3} = x + 2$, where $n$ is the number of quizzes taken. Cross multiplying gives $x \cdot n + 11 = (x + 1)(n + 1)$ and $x \cdot n + 11 \cdot 2 = (x + 2)(n + 3)$. Expanding gives $xn + 11 = xn + x + n + 1$ and $2n + 22 = xn + 3x + 2n + 6$. Subtracting $xn$, $x$, and $n$ from both sides of the first equation gives $10 = 1$, which is not true. Subtracting $xn$, $x$, and $n$ from both sides of the second equation gives $16 = 2x$, or $x = 8$. Thus, the mean of her quiz scores is $\boxed{8 \ \mathbf{(E)}}$.

Model Final Answer #6: E
Model Answer #6: Let $n$ be the number of quizzes that Maureen has taken so far.
The current sum of her scores is $n$ times the current mean. If she scores an $11$, the sum of her scores will increase by $11$, so the new sum of her scores will be $n$ times the current mean plus $11$.
If she scores an $11$ on each of the next three quizzes, the new sum of her scores will be $n$ times the current mean plus $11+11+11=3\cdot11=33$.
Since the mean increases by $1$ when the sum of her scores increases by $11$ and the mean increases by $2$ when the sum of her scores increases by $33$, the current mean is $\frac{33}{33}=\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 8}$.

Model Final Answer #7: C
Model Answer #7: Let the number of quizzes be $x,$ and the mean be $m.$ We know that $\frac{xm-11}{x-1} = m+1$ and $\frac{xm-33}{x-3} = m+2.$ Solving for $m,$ we have $xm-11 = xm-x+1$ and $xm-33 = xm-3x+6.$ Since the first equation simplifies to $x = 12,$ substituting this into the second equation gives $12m-33 = 12m-36,$ so $m = \boxed{6\ \textbf{(C)}}.$

Model Final Answer #8: C
Model Answer #8: Let's consider what happens when she scores an $11$ on the next quiz. Her mean goes up by $1.$ That means her current mean is $1$ less than her future mean. So if her future mean is $x,$ her current mean is $x-1.$ Therefore, the mean of her quiz scores is $\boxed{6}.$

Model Final Answer #9: abstain
Model Answer #9: Let $n$ be the number of tests Maureen has taken so far, and let $x$ be the mean of her scores.  The total of her scores is $nx$.  If Maureen scores an $11$ on her next test, then her new mean will be $\frac{nx+11}{n+1}$.  We are told that this is $1$ more than $x$.  So we set these two expressions equal to each other: \[\frac{nx+11}{n+1}=x+1.\] Multiplying both sides by $n+1$ and simplifying, we get $nx+11=(x+1)(n+1)$, or $nx+11=nx+n+x+1$.  This simplifies to $11=n+1$, so $n=10$.  Then $x=\frac{nx+11}{n+1}=\frac{10x+11}{11}$, and cross-multiplying gives $11x=10x+11$, or $x=11$.  So the mean of her scores is $\boxed{11}$.

Model Final Answer #10: abstain
Model Answer #10: Let the number of quizzes be $n$, and the mean of her scores be $m$. Then, the total of her quiz scores is $mn$. From the first sentence, we know that $(mn+11)/(n+1)=m+1$. From the second sentence, we know that $(mn+33)/(n+3)=m+2$. Simplifying, we have $mn+11 = m^2+m$ and $mn+33=2m^2+4m$, respectively. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $22 = m^2+3m$. Factoring, we get $0 = m^2+3m-22$. The only factor pairs of $-22$ that differ by $3$ are $-11$ and $2$, so $m = -11$ or $m = 2$. Negative numbers don't make sense in this context, so $m = \boxed{2}$.

11) A square of area $2$ is inscribed in a square of area $3$, creating four congruent triangles, as shown below. What is the ratio of the shorter leg to the longer leg in the shaded right triangle? $A) \frac15 B) \frac14 C) 2-\sqrt3 D) \sqrt3-\sqrt2 E) \sqrt2-1$
Solution: C
Model Final Answer #1: C
Model Answer #1: Let the side length of the smaller square be $x$, so the side length of the larger square is $\sqrt{\frac32}x$. The triangle has legs of length $x$ and an area of $\frac12x^2$, so the length of the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{\frac32}x$. The ratio of the two legs is $\frac{x}{\sqrt{\frac32}x}=\boxed{2-\sqrt3\textbf{(C)}}$.

Model Answer #2: [asy] size(8cm); pair A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I; A=(0,0); B=(sqrt(2),0); C=(0,sqrt(2)); D=(sqrt(2),sqrt(2)); E=(0,sqrt(6)); F=(sqrt(6),sqrt(6)); G=(0,sqrt(3)); H=(sqrt(3),sqrt(3)); I=(sqrt(3),sqrt(6)); draw(A--C--D--B--cycle); draw(E--F--I--H--cycle); draw(C--I); draw(A--D); label("A",A,SW); label("B",B,SE); label("C",C,NW); label("D",D,NE); label("E",E,W); label("F",F,S); label("G",G,W); label("H",H,S); label("I",I,NE); [/asy]
Let $ABCD$ be the outer square with area $3$, and $EFGH$ be the inner square with area $2$, where $E,G$ are on $AB$ and $F,H$ are on $BC$. Let $x=AG$, and therefore $DG=\sqrt{3}-x$. Also, let $y=BG$, and therefore $CG=\sqrt{3}-y$. Finally, let $EF=GH=a$. We now have two ways to find the area of triangle $CGI$. The first is to note that $\triangle CGI$ is congruent to $\triangle EFG$, so $[CGI]=\frac12\cdot a^2$. The second is to write $[CGI]$ as the sum of the areas of $\triangle CDG$ and $\triangle DIC$. We have $[CDG]=\frac12\cdot (\sqrt{3}-y)\cdot (y+(x+y))$ and $[DIC]=\frac12\cdot x \cdot (x+(x+y))$, so \[[CGI]=[CDG]+[DIC]=\frac12\cdot (\sqrt{3}-y)\cdot (2y+x)+\frac12\cdot x \cdot (2x+y).\]Since these two areas are equal, we have \[\frac12\cdot a^2=\frac12\cdot (\sqrt{3}-y)\cdot (2y+x)+\frac12\cdot x \cdot (2x+y).\]Simplifying gives $a^2=x^2-xy+y^2$. We can also find $a^2$ in another way. We have $AB=\sqrt{3}$, so $AG=BG=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Also, $GF=\frac{1}{2}$, so $[AGF]=\frac12\cdot\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\cdot\frac12=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}$. We have $[AGF]=\frac12\cdot a\cdot CG$, so $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}=\frac12\cdot a\cdot (\sqrt{3}-y)$. Simplifying gives $a=\frac{2-y}{4}$. Therefore, $a^2=\frac{(2-y)^2}{16}$, which simplifies to $a^2=\frac{4-4y+y^2}{16}$. Equating this with $a^2=x^2-xy+y^2$ gives \[x^2-xy+y^2=\frac{4-4y+y^2}{16}.\]Multiplying everything by $16$ and cancelling out the $y^2$ terms gives \[16x^2-16xy=\frac{4-4y}{4}.\]Simplifying gives $8x^2-8xy=\frac{1-y}{2}$. We know that $x+y=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so $y=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}-x$. Substituting gives $8x^2-8x\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}-x\right)=\frac{1-\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}-x\right)}{2}$. Simplifying and multiplying everything by $2$ gives \[16x^2-8x\sqrt{3}+8x=1-\sqrt{3}+2x\implies 16x^2-10x\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{3}+1=0.\]By the quadratic formula, $x=\frac{10\sqrt{3}\pm\sqrt{180+192}}{32}=\frac{5\sqrt{3}\pm 2\sqrt{3}}{8}$. Since $x<\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, we have $x=\frac{5\sqrt{3}-2\sqrt{3}}{8}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}$. Substituting this into $x+y=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ gives $y=\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}$. Finally, we have \[\frac{BE}{BF}=\frac{y}{a}=\frac{\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}}{\frac{2-\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}}{4}}=\frac{\frac{3}{8}}{\frac{5}{2}-\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}}=\frac{3}{16}\cdot\frac{16}{10-3\sqrt{3}}=\frac{3}{10-3\sqrt{3}}=\boxed{\textbf{(D) } \sqrt{3}-\sqrt{2}}.\]

Model Final Answer #3: A
Model Answer #3: We begin by drawing our shaded right triangle, as well as the inscribed square and the larger square.
[asy] size(200); pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); pair A=(0,0),B=(0,2),C=(2,2),D=(2,0), E = (1,1); D(MP("A",A)--MP("B",B,W)--MP("C",C,N)--MP("D",D,E)--cycle); D(MP("E",E,NE)); D((0,1)--(2,1),linetype("3 3")+linewidth(0.7)); D((1,0)--(1,2),linetype("3 3")+linewidth(0.7))); D((1,1.2)--(1.2,1.2)--(1.2,1)); D((1,.8)--(1.2,.8)--(1.2,1)); D((.8,1)--(.8,1.2)--(1,1.2)); D((1.2,1)--(1.2,.8)--(1,.8));  [/asy]
We now label a few points. Let $A,B,C,D$ be the vertices of the larger square, with $A$ in the lower-left corner and $C$ in the upper-right corner. Let $E$ be the vertex of the smaller square opposite $A$, and let $F$ be the point in the lower-right corner of the smaller square.
We now extend the lines so that we have the following diagram.
[asy] size(200); pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); pair A=(0,0),B=(0,2),C=(2,2),D=(2,0), E = (1,1); D(MP("A",A)--MP("B",B,W)--MP("C",C,N)--MP("D",D,E)--cycle); D(MP("E",E,NE)); D((0,1)--(2,1),linetype("3 3")+linewidth(0.7)); D((1,0)--(1,2),linetype("3 3")+linewidth(0.7))); D((1,1.2)--(1.2,1.2)--(1.2,1)); D((1,.8)--(1.2,.8)--(1.2,1)); D((.8,1)--(.8,1.2)--(1,1.2)); D((1.2,1)--(1.2,.8)--(1,.8)); D((5,0)--(7,0),linetype("3 3")+linewidth(0.7)); D((5,2)--(7,2),linetype("3 3")+linewidth(0.7)); D((5,0)--(5,2),linetype("3 3")+linewidth(0.7)); D((7,0)--(7,2),linetype("3 3")+linewidth(0.7)); D((5.8,0)--(5.8,2),linetype("3 3")+linewidth(0.7)); MP("\frac 12",(4.5,1),W); MP("\frac 12",(5.5,1),E); MP("\frac 12",(6.5,1),E); MP("\frac 12",(7.5,1),E); MP("\frac 12",(5.5,2.5),N); MP("\frac 12",(6,2.5),N); MP("\frac 12",(6.5,2.5),N); MP("\frac 12",(7,.5),N); [/asy]
In the diagram on the right, each square has an area of $\frac 12$. Therefore, the long leg of our triangle is of length $\frac 12 + \frac 12 = 1$, and the short leg of our triangle is of length $\frac 12 - \frac 12 = 0$. Therefore, the ratio of the short leg to the long leg is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ \frac15}$.

By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have
\[k^2 = 1^2 + (m-1)^2\]
\[k^2 = 1 + m^2 - 2m + 1\]
\[k^2 = 2 + m^2 - 2m\]
\[k^2 + 2m = 2 + m^2\]
\[k^2 + 2m - 2 = m^2\]
We seek to find $\frac{BH}{HG} = \frac{k}{m-k} = \frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{m - (\sqrt{2}-1)} = \frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{m-\sqrt{2}+1} = \frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{m-1-\sqrt{2}+2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{m+1-\sqrt{2}}$.
We will now find $m$. Note that $\triangle HCG \sim \triangle ABC$, so we have
\[\frac{m}{2} = \frac{1}{1}\]
\[m = \frac{2}{1}\]
We have $k^2 = m^2 - 2m + 2 = 4-4+2 = 2$, so $k = \sqrt{2}$, and
\[\frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{m+1-\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{2+1-\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{3-\sqrt{2}} = \frac{(\sqrt{2}-1)(3+\sqrt{2})}{(3-\sqrt{2})(3+\sqrt{2})} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{2}+3-1}{3^2 - (\sqrt{2})^2} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}+2}{9-2} = \frac{2(\sqrt{2}+1)}{7} = \boxed{\textbf{(E) } \sqrt{2} - 1}\]

Since the smaller square has area $2$ and the larger $3$, we see that the ratio of side lengths is $\sqrt{\dfrac32}$. The small right triangle with a leg of length $1$ and hypotenuse of length $2$ is a $30-60-90$ triangle, so the other leg has length $\sqrt3$. The other leg of the larger right triangle is $\sqrt3 \cdot \sqrt{\dfrac32} = \sqrt{\dfrac92}$, and the hypotenuse has length $1 \cdot \sqrt{\dfrac32} = \sqrt{\dfrac32}$. The ratio of the legs is $\dfrac{\sqrt{\dfrac92}}{\sqrt{\dfrac32}} = \dfrac{\frac{\sqrt9}{\sqrt2}}{\sqrt{\dfrac32}} = \dfrac{\sqrt3}{\sqrt{\dfrac32}} = \dfrac{\sqrt3}{\sqrt{\dfrac32}} \cdot \dfrac{\sqrt{\dfrac23}}{\sqrt{\dfrac23}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{\dfrac92}}{\sqrt2} = \sqrt{\dfrac{\dfrac92}{2}} = \sqrt{\dfrac94} = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }\sqrt2-1}$.

Model Answer #6: Let the side length of the larger square be $x$. The side length of the smaller square is then $\sqrt{\frac{2}{x^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{x}$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the legs of the shaded right triangle have lengths $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{x}$ and $x-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{x}$. Their ratio is $\frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{x}}{x-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{x}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{x^2-\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{(x+\sqrt{2})(x-\sqrt{2})} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{x^2-2}$. The area of the larger square is $x^2 = 3$ so $x = \sqrt{3}$ and $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{(x+\sqrt{2})(x-\sqrt{2})} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3-2} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }\frac{1}{5}}$.

Model Final Answer #8: E
Model Answer #8: Let the side length of the small square be $x$. Then the area of the larger square is $x^2 + 4(\frac{1}{2}x)^2 = 3$, or $x^2 = 1$. The side length of the larger square is then $\sqrt{3}$. 
The larger right triangle has legs of lengths $x$ and $\sqrt{3} - x$. The ratio of the shorter leg to the longer leg is $\frac{x}{\sqrt{3} - x}$. We can find $x$ by drawing a perpendicular from the corner of the small square to the side of the large square. This perpendicular has length $x$, so by the Pythagorean Theorem, we find that $x^2 + (\sqrt{3} - x)^2 = (\sqrt{2})^2$, or $x^2 - 2x\sqrt{3} + 3 - 2 = x^2 - 2x\sqrt{3} + 1 = 0$. The solution $x = \sqrt{3} - 1$ is extraneous because it would make the side length of the small square negative, so we take $x = 1 - \sqrt{3}$. Then the ratio of the shorter leg to the longer leg is $\frac{1-\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} - (1- \sqrt{3})} = \boxed{\sqrt{2} - 1}$.

Model Final Answer #9: D
Model Answer #9: Let the side length of the large square be $s$, so $s^2 = 3$.  Let the side length of the small square be $x$, so $x^2 = 2$.  Then the legs of the shaded right triangle are $s-x$ and $s-2x$.  Since the shaded triangle and the non-shaded triangle are similar, we have \[
\frac{s-2x}{s-x} = \frac{x}{s-2x}.
\]Cross-multiplying gives $(s-2x)^2 = x(s-x)$.  Expanding the square on the left gives \[
s^2-4sx+4x^2 = sx-x^2,
\]so $s^2-5x^2 = 3-5\cdot 2 = -7$.  Hence $x^2 = \frac{7}{5}$, so $x = \frac{\sqrt{35}}5$.  The ratio of the legs of the shaded triangle is then \[
\frac{s-2x}{s-x} = \frac{s/x-2}{s/x-1} = \frac{5 - 2\sqrt{35}}{5-\sqrt{35}} = \frac{(5-2\sqrt{35})(5+\sqrt{35})}{(5-\sqrt{35})(5+\sqrt{35})} = \frac{ - 5 -2 \sqrt{35} + 10 \sqrt{35} - 70}{-5 + \sqrt{35} + 5 \sqrt{35} - 35} = \frac{10 \sqrt{35} - 75}{6 \sqrt{35} - 40} = \frac{5 \sqrt{35} - 15}{3 \sqrt{35} - 20} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) } \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}}.

Let $ABCD$ be the larger square, and let $PQRS$ be the smaller square.
Let $AP=a$, $AQ=b$, and $AS=c$.
Note that $\triangle APS$ is a $45-45-90$ triangle, so $AP=AS$.
Also, note that $\triangle APQ$ is similar to $\triangle CBR$, so $\frac{AP}{CB}=\frac{AQ}{BR}=\frac{AS}{CR}$.
Thus, $\frac{a}{b+c}=\frac{a+c}{b}$.
Cross multiplying and simplifying, we get $a^2+ac=ab+bc$, or $a^2+ac-ab-bc=0$.
Factoring, we get $a(a-c)-b(a-c)=0$, so $(a-c)(a-b)=0$.
Thus, $a=b$ or $a=c$.
We can rule out the case $a=b$ since then $PQRS$ would be a square with area $2$.
Therefore, we have $a=c$.
Let $a=c=x$. Then $b=2x$.
The ratio of the legs of the right triangle $AFG$ is $FG/AF=x/2x=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac14}$.

12) How many three-digit positive integers $N$ satisfy the following properties? The number $N$ is divisible by $7$. The number formed by reversing the digits of $N$ is divisible by $5$. $A)  13  B)  14  C)  15  D)  16  E)  17$
Solution: B
Model Final Answer #1: D
Model Answer #1: $7$ is a unit in $\mathbb{Z}/10\mathbb{Z}$, so we need $\text{reverse}(N) \equiv 0 \pmod 5$. The three-digit multiples of $7$ are $105$, $112$, $119$, $\dots$, $994$, $1001$. Note that $\text{reverse}(105)=501$, $\text{reverse}(112)=211$, $\text{reverse}(119)=911$, and so on. For the hundreds digit, we can choose any digit from $1$ to $9$, inclusive, so there are $9$ choices. As for the tens digit, we can choose any digit from $0$ to $9$, inclusive, as long as $\text{reverse}(N) \equiv 0 \pmod 5$. Thus, we can choose any digit from $0$ to $9$ that is congruent to $5$ modulo $2$, i.e. $0,2,4,6,8$. Therefore, there are $5$ choices. Finally, for the units digit, we can choose any digit from $0$ to $9$, inclusive, and still have $\text{reverse}(N) \equiv 0 \pmod 5$. Hence, there are $10$ choices. In total, there are $9\times 5 \times 10 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }16}$ three-digit positive integers that satisfy the given conditions.

Model Final Answer #2: C
Model Answer #2: We know that $N \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$. Since $1000 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$, we can write $N$ as $7n + 1001a$, where $n$ and $a$ are integers. We also know that $N \equiv 0 \pmod {5}$. Thus, $7n + 1001a \equiv 0 \pmod {5}$ which implies $2n + a \equiv 0 \pmod {5}$. We test values of $a$ to get $a \equiv 3 \pmod {5}$, $a \equiv 8 \pmod {5}$, $a \equiv 13 \pmod {5}$, $a \equiv 18 \pmod {5}$, $a \equiv 23 \pmod {5}$, $a \equiv 28 \pmod {5}$, $a \equiv 33 \pmod {5}$. We can easily see that the first few solutions are $13, 108, 203, 298, 303, 398, 493$. We know that we have to add $5$ each time because we are adding $5$ to $a$. Thus, the number of solutions is $7 + 2(5)=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 15}$.

Model Final Answer #3: E
Model Answer #3: To make a number divisible by $7$ that is less than $1000$, the only possibilities are $112,126,133,154,161,182,203,217,224,238,245,266,273,287,301,308,322,329,336,343,357,364,371,385,392,399,406,427,434,448,455,469,476,497,511,518,532,539,546,553,567,574,581,595,602,616,623,637,644,658,665,679,686,693,700,714,721,735,742,749,756,763,770,777,791,798,812,819,826,833,847,854,861,868,875,889,896,910,917,931,938,952,959,973,980,987,994$. Now we need to check to see if the reverse of any of these numbers are divisible by $5$. 
We conclude that $5$ numbers work. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 17}$.

Model Final Answer #4: D
Model Answer #4: Recall that $N$ has exactly $\frac{999-100}{7} + 1 = 128$ factors of $7$. Thus, $N$ can be expressed as $7 \cdot k$ for any integer $k$ between $100$ and $999$, inclusive.
Now, let's look at the number formed by reversing the digits of $N$. Suppose that $N = 100a + 10b + c$. Then the number formed by reversing the digits of $N$ is $100c + 10b + a = 5 \cdot (20c + 2b) + a$. This is divisible by $5$, so $a$ must be divisible by $5$.
Therefore, $N$ can be expressed as $7 \cdot 5 \cdot k = 35 \cdot k$ for any integer $k$ between $20$ and $199$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $199-20+1 = 180$.
However, we have overcounted. Some of the numbers in our list ($20, 25, 30, \ldots, 195$) are divisible by $5$ but not by $7$. The answer is $\frac{180 - 195}{5} + 1 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) } 16}$.

Model Final Answer #5: B
Model Answer #5: We know that $N \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ and $N \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $N \equiv 0 \pmod{35}$.
We notice that when we reverse the digits of a number, its remainder when divided by $10$ stays the same. For example, $123 \equiv 3 \pmod{10}$, and $321 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}$. Thus, $N \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$ implies that the units digit of $N$ is $0$ or $5$.
Since $N$ is a three-digit number, we know that it is in the form $\underline{a} \underline{b} \underline{c}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits.
From $N \equiv 0 \pmod{35}$, we see that $10a + b + c \equiv 0 \pmod{35}$. This means that $10a + b + c$ is a multiple of $35$. We have $a, b, c \leq 9$, but $10a + b + c$ is a multiple of $35$, so $10a + b + c$ must be $35$ or $70$. Thus, $(a, b, c)$ must be one of $(3, 5, 0)$, $(7, 0, 0)$, $(0, 5, 0)$, or $(0, 0, 0)$.
For the first case, the number $N$ is $350$. For the second case, the number $N$ is $700$. For the third case, the number $N$ is $50$. For the fourth case, there is no three-digit number that has all $0$s as its digits. Thus, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 14}$ possible values of $N$.

Model Final Answer #6: A
Model Answer #6: Note that since $N$ is divisible by 7, the units digit of $N$ must be either 0, 3, 6, or 9. 
We consider each case separately. 
If the units digit of $N$ is 0, then $N$ must be divisible by 10, so $N$ must be equal to 100 or 200. The number formed by reversing the digits of $N$ is 1 or 2, neither of which is divisible by 5. 
If the units digit of $N$ is 3, then the number formed by reversing the digits of $N$ must be 3, 13, 23, etc. However, none of these numbers are divisible by 5. 
If the units digit of $N$ is 6, then the number formed by reversing the digits of $N$ must be 6, 16, 26, etc. However, none of these numbers are divisible by 5. 
If the units digit of $N$ is 9, then the number formed by reversing the digits of $N$ must be 9, 19, 29, etc. However, none of these numbers are divisible by 5. 
Thus, there are $\boxed{0 \text{ (A)}}$ three-digit positive integers that satisfy the given conditions.

Model Final Answer #7: abstain
Model Answer #7: We know that $N$ is divisible by $7$ and $N$ reversed is divisible by $5$. Thus, $N$ reversed is divisible by $35$. We are looking for the number of three-digit positive integers $N$ for which $N$ reversed is divisible by $35$. 
The first three-digit positive integer $N$ for which $N$ reversed is divisible by $35$ is $N=105$. The next is $N=140$, and so on, until $N=980$. Thus, the number of three-digit positive integers $N$ for which $N$ reversed is divisible by $35$ is $980/35=28$. 
However, we must exclude the numbers that are divisible by $7$ and $5$. The smallest positive three-digit multiple of $35$ is $105$. The smallest three-digit number that is divisible by $7$ and $5$ is $105$. Thus, $105$ is the only number that is counted twice. Since there are $28$ numbers that work, and only one is counted twice, there are $28-1=27$ numbers that work. 
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{27}$.

Model Final Answer #8: D
Model Answer #8: We can solve this problem with modular arithmetic. Let $N = 100a + 10b + c$. We know that $N \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$, so $100a + 10b + c \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$. Simplifying, we find that $2a + 3b + c \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$.

We can see that there are $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\,16}$ possible values of $N$.

Model Final Answer #9: D
Model Answer #9: The first three-digit multiple of $7$ is $105$, and the last is $994$. We consider each case separately.
Case $1$: The hundreds digit is $1$.
The tens digit must be $0$ or $2$ since $100$ to $199$ are the only three-digit numbers with a hundreds digit of $1$. If the tens digit is $0$, the units digit is $7$ (since it must be divisible by $7$ and $57$ is divisible by $5$). This gives us $1$ number. If the tens digit is $2$, the units digit is $0$ (since it is divisible by $5$ and $27$ is divisible by $7$). This gives us $1$ number. Therefore, there is $1+1=2$ numbers in this case.
Case $2$: The hundreds digit is $2$.
The tens digit cannot be $0$ or $2$ (since $205$ is the first three-digit number that could work). If the tens digit is $1$, the units digit is $4$ (since $14$ is divisible by $7$ and $41$ is divisible by $5$). This gives us $1$ number. If the tens digit is $3$, the units digit is $7$ (since $37$ is divisible by $7$ and $73$ is divisible by $5$). This gives us $1$ number. Therefore, there is $1+1=2$ numbers in this case.
Case $3$: The hundreds digit is $3$.
The tens digit cannot be $0$, $2$, or $3$ (since $305$ is the first three-digit number that could work). If the tens digit is $1$, the units digit is $1$ (since $11$ is divisible by $7$ and $11$ is divisible by $5$). This gives us $1$ number. If the tens digit is $4$, the units digit is $4$ (since $44$ is divisible by $7$ and $44$ is divisible by $5$). This gives us $1$ number. If the tens digit is $5$, the units digit is $7$ (since $57$ is divisible by $7$ and $75$ is divisible by $5$). This gives us $1$ number. If the tens digit is $6$, the units digit is $0$ (since $60$ is divisible by $7$ and $06$ is divisible by $5$). This gives us $1$ number. Therefore, there is $1+1+1+1=4$ numbers in this case.
Case $4$: The hundreds digit is $4$.
The tens digit cannot be $0$, $2$, $3$, or $6$ (since $405$ is the first three-digit number that could work). If the tens digit is $1$, the units digit is $8$ (since $18$ is divisible by $7$ and $81$ is divisible by $5$). This gives us $1$ number. If the tens digit is $4$, the units digit is $1$ (since $41$ is divisible by $7$ and $14$ is divisible by $5$). This gives us $1$ number. If the tens digit is $5$, the units digit is $4$ (since $54$ is divisible by $7$ and $45$ is divisible by $5$). This gives us $1$ number. Therefore, there is $1+1+1=3$ numbers in this case.
Case $5$: The hundreds digit is $5$.
The tens digit cannot be $0$, $2$, $3$, $4$, or $6$ (since $505$ is the first three-digit number that could work). If the tens digit is $1$, the units digit is $5$ (since $15$ is divisible by $7$ and $51$ is divisible by $5$). This gives us $1$ number. If the tens digit is $5$, the units digit is $5$ (since $55$ is divisible by $7$ and $55$ is divisible by $5$). This gives us $1$ number. Therefore, there is $1+1=2$ numbers in this case.
Case $6$: The hundreds digit is $6$.
The tens digit cannot be $0$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, or $6$ (since $605$ is the first three-digit number that could work). If the tens digit is $1$, the units digit is $2$ (since $12$ is divisible by $7$ and $21$ is divisible by $5$). This gives us $1$ number. If the tens digit is $7$, the units digit is $0$ (since $70$ is divisible by $7$ and $07$ is divisible by $5$). This gives us $1$ number. Therefore, there is $1+1=2$ numbers in this case.
Case $7$: The hundreds digit is $7$.
The tens digit cannot be $0$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, or $7$ (since $705$ is the first three-digit number that could work). If the tens digit is $1$, the units digit is $9$ (since $19$ is divisible by $7$ and $91$ is divisible by $5$). This gives us $1$ number. If the tens digit is $8$, the units digit is $0$ (since $80$ is divisible by $7$ and $08$ is divisible by $5$). This gives us $1$ number. Therefore, there is $1+1=2$ numbers in this case.
We have $2+2+4+3+2+2+2=\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 16}$ numbers in total.

Model Final Answer #10: E
Model Answer #10: By the divisibility rule for 7, a number is divisible by 7 iff the difference between its last digit and twice its other digits is a multiple of 7. So we must have $\underline{abc} - 2 \cdot \underline{ab} = \underline{c} - 2 \cdot \underline{b}a \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$. In other words, $2 \cdot \underline{b} + \underline{c} \equiv 10 \cdot \underline{b} + \underline{a} \pmod{7}$.
Since $10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}$, we have $2 \cdot \underline{b} + \underline{c} \equiv 3 \cdot \underline{b} + \underline{a} \pmod{7}$. Since $3 \cdot 1 \equiv 3$, $3 \cdot 2 \equiv 6$, $3 \cdot 3 \equiv 2$, $3 \cdot 4 \equiv 5$, $3 \cdot 5 \equiv 1$, $3 \cdot 6 \equiv 4$, and $3 \cdot 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$, we must have $\underline{c} \equiv 3 \cdot \underline{b} + \underline{a} \pmod{7}$. (Note that this is a one-to-one correspondence, since we can uniquely determine $\underline{a}$ and $\underline{b}$ from $\underline{c}$.)
Now, the number $N = 100 \cdot \underline{a} + 10 \cdot \underline{b} + \underline{c}$ must be divisible by 5. By the divisibility rule for 5, this means that $\underline{c} = 0$ or $\underline{c} = 5$. However, since $2 \cdot \underline{b} + \underline{c} \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$, we must have $\underline{c} = 0$. This gives us $\underline{a} \equiv 3 \cdot \underline{b} \pmod{7}$.
Since $1 \cdot 3 \equiv 3$, $2 \cdot 3 \equiv 6$, $3 \cdot 3 \equiv 2$, $4 \cdot 3 \equiv 5$, $5 \cdot 3 \equiv 1$, $6 \cdot 3 \equiv 4$, and $7 \cdot 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$, we must have $\underline{a} \equiv 3 \cdot \underline{b} \pmod{7}$. Thus, we have a one-to-one correspondence between the values of $\underline{a}$ and $\underline{b}$. There are 7 values of both $\underline{a}$ and $\underline{b}$, so there are $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }17}$ possible values of $N$.

Solution: C
Model Final Answer #1: abstain
Model Answer #1: Let $B$ be the location of Bharat.  Since Bharat is as far away from Abdul as possible, line $AB$ is perpendicular to line $AC$.  Also, since the angle between lines $AC$ and $BC$ is $60^\circ$, triangle $ABC$ is a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle.  Therefore, $BC = AB \sqrt{3} = (AB)(\sqrt{3}) = 48$, so $AB = \frac{48}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{48\sqrt{3}}{3} = 16\sqrt{3}$.  Then $AB^2 = (16\sqrt{3})^2 = 256\cdot 3 = \boxed{768}$.

Let $AB = AC = a$ and $AD = b$. Then $BD = \frac a2$, so $\triangle ABD$ is a $30-60-90$ triangle, and $b = \frac a{\sqrt{3}}$.
By the Law of Cosines on triangle $ABC$,
\[a^2 = a^2 + \left(\frac a2\right)^2 - 2\left(a\left(\frac a2\right)\right)\cos 60^\circ = \frac{3a^2}4 - \frac a2\]
\[3a^2 - 4a - 4a = 0\]
\[a = 4\sqrt{3}\]
\[b = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = 4\]
So $BD^2 = 4^2 - 4^2 = 16$, and $AD^2 = 48^2 - 4^2 = 2304$. Finally, $AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 = 2304 + 16 = 2320$, so the answer is $\boxed{6912}$.

Model Answer #3: Let $\angle A = \angle B = 90^{\circ}$ and $\angle C = 60^{\circ}$. Then, $AB = 48$.

Then, by $30-60-90$ triangles, $AX = \frac{x}{2}$ and $BX = \frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2}$. By Pythagorean theorem, $AB^2 = AX^2 + BX^2$, so $48^2 = \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2$. Solving, $x^2 = \frac{4608}{4} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 3072}$

Let $C$, $D$, and $E$ be the respective positions of Abdul, Bharat, and Chiang.  Let $F$, $H$, and $J$ be the respective projections of $D$ onto $\overline{AC}$, $\overline{BC}$, $\overline{AB}$, and $G$, $I$, and $K$ be the respective projections of $D$ onto $\overline{BC}$, $\overline{AC}$, $\overline{AB}$.  If we let $x = CD = CE$, $y = DH = DI$, and $z = HJ = IK$, then $CF = \sqrt{49 - y^2}$ and $CF = \sqrt{64 - z^2}$.
By the Law of Cosines on $\triangle DCF$, we have
\[x^2 = (7-y)^2 + 49 - 2(7-y)\sqrt{49-y^2}\cos 60^\circ = y^2 - 14y + 49.\]
Similarly, we have
\[x^2 = z^2 - 16z + 64.\]
Since $BC = 48$, $z = 48 - y$, so $x^2 = y^2 - 14y + 49 = (48-y)^2 - 16(48-y) + 64$.  Expanding these, we obtain $y^2 - 34y + 49 = y^2 - 80y + 1600 - 16y + 64$, or $66y = 1511$, so $y = \frac{1511}{66}$.  It follows that $x^2 = \frac{1511}{66}^2 - \frac{1511}{66}\cdot 14 + 49 = \frac{1511^2 - 66\cdot 1511\cdot 14 + 66^2\cdot 49}{66^2} = \frac{1511^2 - 66\cdot 1511\cdot 14 + 66^2\cdot 49}{(2\cdot 3\cdot 11)^2}$.  Since $1511 = 11\cdot 137$ and $137^2 - 14\cdot 137 + 49 = 14400$, we have
\[x^2 = \frac{11^2\cdot 14400}{6^2\cdot 11^2} = \boxed{400}.\]

Model Answer #5: Label points as shown below. Since $\angle ABC = 60^\circ$, $\triangle ABC$ is equilateral, so $AC = 48$. By the Law of Cosines on $\triangle ABC$, we have
\[BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cos 60^\circ = AB^2 + 48^2 - AB \cdot 48.\]Then by the Law of Cosines on $\triangle ABC$, we have
\begin{align*} BC^2 &= AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cos 120^\circ \\ &= AB^2 + 48^2 + AB \cdot 48. \end{align*}Equating these two expressions for $BC^2$, we get
\[AB^2 + 48^2 - AB \cdot 48 = AB^2 + 48^2 + AB \cdot 48,\]which simplifies to $AB = 0$.  Then $AC = 48$, so the square of the distance between Abdul and Bharat is $AB^2 + BC^2 = \boxed{2304}$.

Model Answer #6: We know that
\[\tan 60^\circ = \frac{BC}{48} = \sqrt{3}.\]
Therefore, $BC = 48 \sqrt{3}$.  Then $AB = BC - AC = 48 \sqrt{3} - 48 = 48 (\sqrt{3} - 1)$.  Therefore, $AB^2 = 2304 \cdot 2 \cdot (\sqrt{3} - 1) = \boxed{4608}$.

Model Final Answer #7: C
Model Answer #7: Let $A,B,C$ be Abdul, Bharat, Chiang, respectively.  Let $X$ be the point such that triangle $ABX$ is equilateral.  Then, $\angle ABX = 60^\circ$ and $\angle BAX = 60^\circ$.  Thus, $\angle BAC = 120^\circ$.  We have $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, so $AC=BC=48$, and $AB=AX+XB=48+48=96$.  We wish to find $AB^2=96^2=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 3072}$

Then $\angle BDC=30^\circ$, so $\angle BDC=\angle BCD$.
Thus, $BD=DC$.
By the Pythagorean Theorem, $AC=48$ and $DC=\frac12AC=24$.
By the Law of Cosines on triangle $DBC$, $BC^2=BD^2+DC^2-2(BD)(DC)\cos 30^\circ=BD^2+BD\cdot DC=BD(BD+DC)=BD\cdot BC$.
Thus $BC=BD=DC=24$.  By the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $ABC$, $AB^2=BC^2+AC^2=24^2+48^2=576+2304=2880=12^2\cdot 80$, so $AB=12\sqrt{80}$, and $AB^2=\boxed{6912}$.

Let $D$ be Bharat and $E$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $AD$. We can see that $\triangle ABC$ is an equilateral triangle, because $\angle ABC = \angle BCA = \angle CAB = 60^{\circ}$. Thus, $AC = BC = AB = 48$. By $30-60-90$ triangles, we have $AD = 24$. 
$DE = AD - AE = AD - AB = 24 - 48 = -24$. Since this is impossible, we must conclude that our original assumption, that $D$ is on $AD$, is incorrect. Thus, $D$ is on $AB$. 
Letting $AD = 24 = AE$, $AB = 48 = AF = AG$, we have $DE = 48 - (-24) = 72$ and $AE = 24$. Letting $F$ be on $BC$ such that $DF$ is perpendicular to $BC$, $DF = DE - EF = 72 - 24\sqrt{3}$. Thus, by the Pythagorean Theorem on $\triangle DAF$, $AD^2 = DF^2 + AF^2 = (72 - 24\sqrt{3})^2 + 48^2 = (72 - 24\sqrt{3})^2 + (3 \cdot 16)^2 = (3 \cdot 24 - 24\sqrt{3})^2 + 3^2 \cdot 16^2 = 3^2 \cdot (8 - \sqrt{3})^2 + 3^2 \cdot 16^2 = 3^2 \cdot (8^2 - 2 \cdot 8 \cdot \sqrt{3} + (\sqrt{3})^2 + 16^2) = 3^2 \cdot (64 - 16\sqrt{3} + 3 + 256) = 9 \cdot 323 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }3072}$.

14) A number is chosen at random from among the first $100$ positive integers, and a positive integer divisor of that number is then chosen at random. What is the probability that the chosen divisor is divisible by $11$? $A) \frac{4}{100} B) \frac{9}{200} C) \frac{1}{20}  D) \frac{11}{200} E) \frac{3}{50}$
Solution: B
Model Final Answer #1: B
Model Answer #1: We consider the prime factorizations of the first $100$ positive integers. 
To be divisible by $11$ the number must have at least one $11$ in its prime factorization. 
The first $100$ positive integers have $9$ $11$s in their prime factorizations: $11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99$.
Any multiple of these numbers will also have a factor of $11$.
The total number of factors we can choose is $100$. 
Therefore, the probability is $\frac{9}{100} \Rightarrow \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{9}{200}}$.

Model Final Answer #2: B
Model Answer #2: We can see that there are $9$ positive two-digit multiples of $11$ less than or equal to $100$. Since there are $100$ numbers to choose from, the probability is $\frac{9}{100} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{9}{200} \ \mathbf{(B)}}$.

Model Final Answer #3: abstain
Model Answer #3: The probability that a randomly chosen positive integer is divisible by $11$ is $\frac{1}{11}$ (since there are $9$ multiples of $11$ from $11$ to $99$ and $99 - 11 + 1 = 89$ total integers in that range). However, we are choosing a divisor, which means that the probability that a multiple of $11$ will be chosen is higher than $\frac{1}{11}$. Specifically, if $x$ is a multiple of $11$, then $x$ can be written as $11y$ for some integer $y$. Then, if $x$ is chosen, the probability that we choose $y$ as a divisor is $\frac{1}{y}$. We see that $y$ can be any positive integer less than or equal to $\frac{x}{11}$, so there are $\left\lfloor \frac{x}{11} \right\rfloor$ possible values for $y$. So the probability that $y$ is chosen is $\frac{1}{\left\lfloor \frac{x}{11} \right\rfloor}$. We want to find the probability that $11$ is a divisor of $x$, so we want to find the probability that $y = 1$. We have that $\frac{1}{\left\lfloor \frac{x}{11} \right\rfloor}$ is the probability that $y$ is chosen, so substituting we find that the probability that $11$ is a divisor of $x$ is $\frac{1}{\left\lfloor \frac{x}{11} \right\rfloor}$. So the desired probability is \[\frac{1}{\left\lfloor \frac{100}{11} \right\rfloor} = \frac{1}{9} = \boxed{\frac{1}{9}}.\]

Model Final Answer #4: D
Model Answer #4: Let's count the number of divisors that are not divisible by 11. The prime factorization of the number must be of the form $p_1^{a_1}\cdot p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_n^{a_n}$. In order for the number to be divisible by 11, one of the prime factors must be 11. A number less than 100 can have at most 2 prime factors, so we will consider the cases where there is 1 prime factor and 2 prime factors separately.

Case 1: 1 prime factor
The number must be in the form $11^a$, where $a$ is an integer. There are only 2 divisors: 1 and $11^a$. The probability that the divisor is not divisible by 11 is $\frac{1}{2}$.

Case 2: 2 prime factors
The number must be in the form $p^a\cdot 11^b$, where $p$ is a prime number other than 11 and $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. There are 9 prime numbers less than 100 that are not equal to 11: 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. There are 2 choices for the power of 11: 1 and 2. Thus, there are $9\cdot 2 = 18$ numbers with 2 prime factors. The number of divisors in this case is $(a+1)(b+1) = 2\cdot 2 = 4$. We want to count the number of divisors that are not divisible by 11. The number of divisors that are divisible by 11 is equal to the number of divisors of $p^a$ minus 1. The number of divisors of $p^a$ is $a+1$. Thus, the number of divisors that are not divisible by 11 is $4 - (a+1) = 3 - a$, where $a$ is 0 or 1. Thus, the number of divisors in this case that are not divisible by 11 is $3 - a = 3 - 0 = 3$ if $a = 0$ and $3 - a = 2$ if $a = 1$. The probability that a divisor in this case is not divisible by 11 is $\frac{3}{4}\cdot \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{8}$ if $a = 0$ and $\frac{2}{4}\cdot \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{4}$ if $a = 1$. Thus, the probability that a divisor in this case is not divisible by 11 is $\frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{8}$.

The probability that the chosen divisor is not divisible by 11 is $\frac{1}{2}$ if the number has 1 prime factor and $\frac{5}{8}$ if the number has 2 prime factors. There are 10 numbers less than 100 with 1 prime factor and 18 numbers with 2 prime factors. The probability that the chosen number has 1 prime factor is $\frac{10}{100} = \frac{1}{10}$ and the probability that the chosen number has 2 prime factors is $\frac{18}{100} = \frac{9}{50}$. The probability that the chosen divisor is not divisible by 11 is $\frac{1}{10}\cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{9}{50}\cdot \frac{5}{8} = \frac{1}{20} + \frac{45}{400} = \frac{1}{20} + \frac{9}{80} = \frac{3}{50}$. The probability that the chosen divisor is divisible by 11 is equal to 1 minus the probability that the chosen divisor is not divisible by 11. Thus, the probability that the chosen divisor is divisible by 11 is $1 - \frac{3}{50} = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{11}{200}}$.

Model Final Answer #5: B
Model Answer #5: Since a number can be prime factorized in exactly one way, we can assign to each number between $1$ and $100$ a unique prime factorization. Now, we can count the number of numbers from $1$ to $100$ that have a factor of $11$, and we can also count the number of prime factorizations of numbers from $1$ to $100$ that have $11$ as a factor. We can then divide those two numbers in order to get the probability. We can use complementary counting in order to do this. 
The numbers from $1$ to $100$ that have a factor of $11$ are $11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99.$
Now, the prime factorizations of the numbers from $1$ to $100$ that have $11$ as a factor are $11, 11\cdot2, 11\cdot3, 11\cdot2^2, 11\cdot5, 11\cdot2\cdot3, 11\cdot7, 11\cdot2^3, 11\cdot3^2.$
Thus, the probability that the chosen divisor is divisible by $11$ is $\frac{9}{100} = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{9}{200}}$.

Model Final Answer #6: E
Model Answer #6: There are $9$ multiples of $11$ between $1$ and $100$. Any multiple of $11$ will have $4$ positive divisors ($1$, the number itself, and two prime factors). All other numbers will have $2$ positive divisors ($1$ and the number itself). There are $100$ numbers to choose from, and $9$ multiples of $11$. Therefore, the probability is $\frac{9 \cdot 4}{100 \cdot 2} = \frac{9}{50} \Rightarrow \boxed{\textbf{(E)} \frac{3}{50}}$

Model Final Answer #7: abstain
Model Answer #7: We use complementary counting. We are looking for the probability that the chosen divisor is not divisible by $11$.
The positive integers less than or equal to $100$ that are not divisible by $11$ are $1,2,3,\cdots,9,12,13\cdots,99,100$.
The total number of positive integers less than or equal to $100$ is $100$.
Therefore, the probability that the chosen divisor is not divisible by $11$ is $\frac{9+90}{100}=\frac{99}{100}$.
Hence, the probability that the chosen divisor is divisible by $11$ is $1-\frac{99}{100}=\boxed{\frac{1}{100}}$.

Model Final Answer #8: C
Model Answer #8: Let the chosen number be $N$.
$N$ is divisible by $11$ if and only if it is a multiple of $11$, which occurs for $N=11,22,\ldots,99$, or $9$ values.
Once we have $N$, each of its divisors has a $\frac{1}{d}$ chance of being chosen, where $d$ is the divisor.
Thus, the probability that the chosen divisor is divisible by $11$ is $\frac{1}{11}+\frac{1}{22}+\cdots+\frac{1}{99}=\frac{1}{11}\cdot\left(\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2}+\ldots+\frac{1}{9}\right)=\frac{1}{11}\cdot\left(\frac{29}{20}\right)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{1}{20}}$.

Thus, we need a number to have a difference that is divisible by $11$. There are $9$ positive integers less than $100$ that are divisible by $11$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } \frac{9}{200}}$

Model Final Answer #10: C
Model Answer #10: A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of its digits which are in odd positions subtracted by the sum of its digits which are in even positions is divisible by $11$. Notice that there are $5$ even positions and $5$ odd positions. We now do casework on the digit in the tens place.
Case $1$: The tens digit is $0$. The units digit can be any digit from $1-9$ inclusive, and the probability is $\frac{9}{100}$.
Case $2$: The tens digit is $1$. The units digit can be any digit from $2-9$ inclusive, and the probability is $\frac{8}{100}$.
Case $3$: The tens digits is $2$. The units digit can be any digit from $1-9$ inclusive, and the probability is $\frac{9}{100}$.
Case $4$: The tens digit is $3$. The units digit can be any digit from $1-9$ inclusive, and the probability is $\frac{9}{100}$.
Case $5$: The tens digit is $4$. The units digit can be any digit from $1-9$ inclusive, and the probability is $\frac{9}{100}$.
Case $6$: The tens digit is $5$. The units digit can be any digit from $1-9$ inclusive, and the probability is $\frac{9}{100}$.
Case $7$: The tens digit is $6$. The units digit can be any digit from $1-9$ inclusive, and the probability is $\frac{9}{100}$.
Case $8$: The tens digit is $7$. The units digit can be any digit from $1-9$ inclusive, and the probability is $\frac{9}{100}$.
Case $9$: The tens digit is $8$. The units digit can be any digit from $1-9$ inclusive, and the probability is $\frac{9}{100}$.
Case $10$: The tens digit is $9$. The units digit can be any digit from $1-9$ inclusive, and the probability is $\frac{9}{100}$.
The probability of the first case is $\frac{9}{100}$, the probability of the second case is $\frac{8}{100}$, and the probability of the rest of the cases is $\frac{9}{100}$. Therefore, our answer is $\frac{9+8+9 \cdot 9}{100}=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{1}{20}}$.

15) An even number of circles are nested, starting with a radius of $1$ and increasing by $1$ each time, all sharing a common point. The region between every other circle is shaded, starting with the region inside the circle of radius $2$ but outside the circle of radius $1.$ An example showing $8$ circles is displayed below. What is the least number of circles needed to make the total shaded area at least $2023\pi$? $A)  46  B)  48  C)  56  D)  60  E)  64$
Solution: E
Model Final Answer #1: C
Model Answer #1: Let $S$ be the total shaded region. The shaded region in between two circles is equal to the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle, which is $\pi r_1^2 - \pi r_2^2 = \pi (r_1^2 - r_2^2) = \pi (r_1+r_2)(r_1-r_2)$. Thus, $S$ can be expressed as: 
\begin{align*} S &= \pi (3+1)(3-1) + \pi (5+3)(5-3) + \pi (7+5)(7-5) + \cdots\\ &+ \pi (2n+1+2n-1)(2n+1-2n+1)\\ &= 4\pi + 8\pi + 12\pi + \cdots + 4n\pi\\ &= 4(\pi + 2\pi + 3\pi + \cdots + n\pi)\\ &= 4(\pi(1+2+3+\cdots+n))\\ &= 4(\pi\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2})\\ &= 2\pi n(n+1)\\ \end{align*}
We need to find the least $n$ such that $2\pi n(n+1) \geq 2023\pi$. Dividing both sides by $\pi$ and simplifying gives $2n(n+1) \geq 2023$. Testing values of $n$, we find that $n=32$ does not work, but $n=32$ does. Thus, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 56}$.

----

Model Final Answer #2: C
Model Answer #2: The shaded area is simply the area of the odd numbered circles minus the sum of the areas of the even numbered circles. The sum of the odd numbered circles is $\pi \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[(2i-1)^{2}-(2i-2)^{2}\right]=\pi \sum_{i=1}^{n}(4i-3)$ where $n$ is the number of circles. This simplifies to $\pi(4n^{2}-2n)$. The sum of the even numbered circles is $\pi \sum_{i=1}^{n}(2i)^{2}=\pi \sum_{i=1}^{n}4i^{2}=\pi\left(\frac{4}{3}n(n+1)(2n+1)\right)$ where $n$ is the number of circles. We want to find the smallest $n$ such that $\pi(4n^{2}-2n)-\pi\left(\frac{4}{3}n(n+1)(2n+1)\right)\ge2023\pi$. Dividing by $\pi$ and simplifying gives $4n^{2}-2n-\frac{8}{3}n(n+1)(2n+1)\ge2023$. The left hand side expands to $4n^{2}-2n-\frac{16}{3}n^{3}-\frac{8}{3}n^{2}-\frac{8}{3}n-\frac{8}{3}n^{2}-\frac{4}{3}n-\frac{2}{3}\ge2023$. If you multiply the whole equation by $3$ to eliminate the denominator, and then subtract $2023$ from both sides, we get $12n^{3}+16n^{2}+\frac{10}{3}n-\frac{2023}{3}\ge0$. The only answer choice that works is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 56}$.

Model Final Answer #3: A
Model Answer #3: The shaded area of each annulus is $\pi R^2 - \pi r^2 = \pi(R^2-r^2)$ so we want to find the smallest $n$ such that $2023 \le 2^2-1^2+4^2-3^2+...+n^2-(n-1)^2 = n^2-1$. The smallest integer $n$ such that $n^2-1 \ge 2023$ is $n=46$, so our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }46}$.

Model Final Answer #4: D
Model Answer #4: The area between the $n$th and $(n+2)$th circle is $(n+2)^2\pi-n^2\pi=(4n+4)\pi$. Therefore, the area between the $n$th circle and the $(n+4)$th circle is $4n\pi+8\pi$. The first few areas are $4\pi$, $12\pi$, $24\pi$, $40\pi$, and so on.
Let the desired area be $k\pi$. Then $2(4+12+24+\dots+4n)+8(n+1)\ge k$ or $8(1+2+4+\dots+n)+8(n+1)\ge k$.
Since $1+2+4+\dots+n=2^{n+1}-2$, we get $8(2^{n+1}-1)+8(n+1)\ge k$, or $16n\ge k-16$, or $n\ge \dfrac{k-16}{16}$.
We want to find the smallest $n$ that satisfies this inequality. Since $2023-16=2007$ is a multiple of $16$ and $2007/16=125.4375$, the smallest such $n$ is $125$, and the answer is $125+4=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }60}$.

Model Final Answer #5: A
Model Answer #5: Let $r$ be the radius of the largest circle.
The area of the shaded region between each pair of circles is the difference of the areas of the two circles. The area of the larger circle is $\pi r^2$, and the area of the smaller circle is $\pi (r - 1)^2$. Thus, the area of the shaded region between each pair of circles is $\pi r^2 - \pi (r - 1)^2 = \pi(2r - 1)$.
The sum of the areas of the shaded regions between each pair of circles is therefore $\pi(2 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot 6 + \dots + 2r) = \pi(2 + 4 + 6 + \dots + 2r) = \pi(2 + 4 + 6 + \dots + 2(r - 1) + 2r) = \pi(r(r + 1))$.
We want this sum to be at least $2023\pi$, so we have $r(r + 1) \ge 2023$. Since $44^2 = 1936$ and $45^2 = 2025$, we have $r(r + 1) \ge 2023$ if and only if $r \ge 45$. Thus, the smallest possible value of $r$ is $45$, and the smallest possible number of circles is $45$, so the answer is $\boxed{(A) 46}$.

Model Final Answer #6: A
Model Answer #6: The first circle, with radius $1$, doesn't contribute any shaded area. The second circle, with radius $2$, contributes an area of $3\pi$ (the entire circle minus the unshaded part of the circle of radius $1$). The third circle, with radius $3$, contributes an area of $5\pi$ (the entire circle minus the unshaded parts of the circles of radii $1$ and $2$). The fourth circle, with radius $4$, contributes an area of $7\pi$. And so on.

Therefore, the $n$th circle contributes $2n-1$ to the total shaded area. To find the least number of circles needed to make the total shaded area at least $2023\pi$, we need to find the least $n$ such that $1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2n-1) \ge 2023$. This is the least $n$ such that $n^2 \ge 2023$, which is $n = 46$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 46}$.

Model Final Answer #7: A
Model Answer #7: The shaded area between the $n$th and $(n+1)$th circles is the difference of the areas of the $(n+1)$th and $n$th circles, that is, $\pi((n+1)^2-n^2)=\pi(2n+1).$ Since we are only shading every other region, the total shaded area after $k$ circles is $\pi\left(1+3+5+\cdots+(4k-1)\right)=\pi k^2.$ We want to find the smallest $k$ such that $\pi k^2\geq2023\pi,$ which means that $k^2\geq2023.$ Since $45^2=2025$, and $44^2=1936$, the smallest value of $k$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 46}.$

Model Final Answer #8: D
Model Answer #8: The area of each shaded annulus is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle. Since the radius increases by 1 each time, the area of each shaded annulus is $\pi(2^2-1^2)=3\pi$. Therefore, the shaded area of $n$ circles is $3\pi \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor$. We set this expression to be greater than $2023\pi$ and solve for $n$: \[3\pi \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor>2023\pi \implies \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor>674 \implies \frac{n}{2}>674 \implies n>1348.\] The smallest odd integer greater than $1348$ is $1351$, so the smallest possible value of $n$ is $2 \cdot 1351 = 2702$. Now, we have that $2702$ circles is enough, but we need to subtract some circles in order to add the smaller circles that are removed each time a larger circle is added. Since the first circle does not have a smaller circle removed from it, we subtract $1$ circle. Since the second circle does have a smaller circle removed from it, we add $1$ circle, and so on. Therefore, we subtract $1-1+1-1+ \cdots +1=(-1+1)+(-1+1)+ \cdots =0$ circles. We conclude that the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }60}$.

Model Final Answer #9: A
Model Answer #9: The shaded area between every two circles is equal to the difference between the areas of the larger and the smaller circle. We call this difference the "annular difference". 
Let's first find the annular difference between two consecutive circles. The area of the larger circle is $(r+1)^2\pi = r^2\pi + 2r\pi + \pi$, while the area of the smaller circle is $r^2\pi + r\pi$. The annular difference is therefore $2r\pi + \pi$. For example, the annular difference between the circles of radii $1$ and $2$ is $(2 \cdot 1 \cdot \pi) + \pi = 3\pi$.
The total area of the shaded regions is the sum of the annular differences of all the circles. We can therefore write the following equation:
\[(2 \cdot 1 \cdot \pi + \pi) + (2 \cdot 2 \cdot \pi + \pi) + (2 \cdot 3 \cdot \pi + \pi) + \dots + (2 \cdot n \cdot \pi + \pi) \geq 2023\pi\]
We can simplify this equation as follows:
\begin{align*} (2 \cdot 1 \cdot \pi + \pi) + (2 \cdot 2 \cdot \pi + \pi) + (2 \cdot 3 \cdot \pi + \pi) + \dots + (2 \cdot n \cdot \pi + \pi) & \geq 2023\pi \\ 2\pi(1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + n) + n\pi & \geq 2023\pi \\ 2\pi\cdot\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + n\pi & \geq 2023\pi \\ n(n+1) + n & \geq 2023 \\ n^2 + 2n & \geq 2023 \\ n^2 + 2n - 2023 & \geq 0 \end{align*}
We can solve this quadratic inequality using the quadratic formula:
\[n = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-2023)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8134}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2033}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2033}\]
The positive solution is $n = \sqrt{2033} - 1 \approx 44.5$, so the smallest integer value of $n$ that satisfies the inequality is $n = 45$. Therefore, the least number of circles needed to make the total shaded area at least $2023\pi$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }46}$.

Model Final Answer #10: B
Model Answer #10: The circle of radius $1$ has area $\pi$, while the circle of radius $2$ has area $4\pi$.  In general, the circle of radius $n$ has area $n^2\pi$.  The total shaded area is \[\pi + 3^2\pi + 5^2\pi + \cdots + n^2\pi,\]where $n$ is the radius of the largest circle.  This is \[\pi(1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + \cdots + n^2).\]The sum of the squares of the odd integers up to $2n - 1$ is \[1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + \cdots + (2n - 1)^2 = \frac{1}{3} (2n - 1)(2n + 1)(2n + 3).\]We want this number to be at least $2023$.  We can check that $n = 16$ gives $2023$, so the least value of $n$ is $16$.  The answer is $1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + 15 = \frac{16 \cdot 8}{2} = \boxed{\textbf{(B) } 48}$.

16) In a table tennis tournament every participant played every other participant exactly once. Although there were twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, the number of games won by left-handed players was $40\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. (There were no ties and no ambidextrous players.) What is the total number of games played? $A) 15 B) 36 C) 45 D) 48 E) 66$
Solution: B
Model Final Answer #1: A
Model Answer #1: Let there be $r$ right-handed players and $l$ left-handed players. Since there are twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, we have $r=2l$. 
The total number of games played is $\binom{r+l}{2}$. 
We are given that the number of games won by left-handed players is $40\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. This means that the left-handed players won $\frac{40}{100}=40\%$ of the total number of games more than the right-handed players. 
Since there are $\binom{l}{2}$ games in which only left-handed players play, the left-handed players won $\binom{l}{2}+\frac{40}{100}\binom{r+l}{2}$ games. 
Similarly, the right-handed players won $\binom{r}{2}+\frac{0}{100}\binom{r+l}{2}$ games. 
Since the number of games won by left-handed players is $40\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players, we have $\binom{l}{2}+\frac{40}{100}\binom{r+l}{2}=\binom{r}{2}+\frac{0}{100}\binom{r+l}{2}$. 
Substituting our values for $r$ and $l$, we have $\binom{l}{2}+\frac{40}{100}\binom{3l}{2}=\binom{2l}{2}$. 
Simplifying, we get $\frac{l(l-1)}{2}+\frac{40}{100}\cdot\frac{3l(3l-1)}{2}=\frac{2l(2l-1)}{2}$. 
Multiplying both sides by $2$ and dividing by $l$, we have $l-1+\frac{40}{100}\cdot(3l-1)=2l-1$. 
Simplifying, we get $l-1+1.2l-0.4=2l-1$. 
Combining like terms, we have $0.2l=0.4$. 
Dividing both sides by $0.2$, we have $l=2$. 
Substituting our value for $l$ into the equation $\binom{l}{2}+\frac{40}{100}\binom{r+l}{2}=\binom{r}{2}+\frac{0}{100}\binom{r+l}{2}$, we have $\binom{2}{2}+\frac{40}{100}\binom{2+2}{2}=\binom{2\cdot2}{2}$. 
Simplifying, we get $1+\frac{40}{100}\cdot\binom{4}{2}=6$. 
Computing $\binom{4}{2}$, we have $1+\frac{40}{100}\cdot6=6$. 
Simplifying, we get $1+2.4=6$. 
Adding, we have $3.4=6$. 
This is never true, so our assumption that there are twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players was incorrect. 
We can use the same method to solve the problem if we assume that there are twice as many left-handed players as right-handed players. 
Let there be $r$ right-handed players and $l$ left-handed players. Since there are twice as many left-handed players as right-handed players, we have $l=2r$. 
The total number of games played is $\binom{r+l}{2}$. 
We are given that the number of games won by left-handed players is $40\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. This means that the left-handed players won $\frac{40}{100}=40\%$ of the total number of games more than the right-handed players. 
Since there are $\binom{r}{2}$ games in which only right-handed players play, the right-handed players won $\binom{r}{2}+\frac{0}{100}\binom{r+l}{2}$ games. 
Similarly, the left-handed players won $\binom{l}{2}+\frac{40}{100}\binom{r+l}{2}$ games. 
Since the number of games won by left-handed players is $40\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players, we have $\binom{r}{2}+\frac{0}{100}\binom{r+l}{2}=\binom{l}{2}+\frac{40}{100}\binom{r+l}{2}$. 
Substituting our values for $r$ and $l$, we have $\binom{r}{2}+\frac{0}{100}\binom{3r}{2}=\binom{2r}{2}+\frac{40}{100}\binom{3r}{2}$. 
Simplifying, we get $\binom{r}{2}=\frac{40}{100}\binom{3r}{2}$. 
Multiplying both sides by $\frac{100}{40}$, we have $\frac{100}{40}\binom{r}{2}=\binom{3r}{2}$. 
Simplifying, we get $2\binom{r}{2}=\binom{3r}{2}$. 
Expanding, we have $r(r-1)=\frac{3r(3r-1)}{2}$. 
Expanding and simplifying, we get $2r^2-2r=\frac{9r^2-3r}{2}$. 
Multiplying both sides by $2$ and dividing by $r$, we have $4r-4=9r-3$. 
Subtracting $4r$ and adding $3$ to both sides, we get $1=5r$. 
Dividing both sides by $5$, we have $r=\frac{1}{5}$. 
Since $r$ represents the number of right-handed players, we cannot have a fraction of a player, so our assumption that there are twice as many left-handed players as right-handed players was incorrect. 
Let there be $r$ right-handed players and $l$ left-handed players. Since there are twice as many left-handed players as right-handed players, we have $l=2r$. 
The total number of games played is $\binom{r+l}{2}$. 
We are given that the number of games won by left-handed players is $40\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. This means that the left-handed players won $\frac{40}{100}=40\%$ of the total number of games more than the right-handed players. 
Since there are $\binom{r}{2}$ games in which only right-handed players play, the right-handed players won $\binom{r}{2}+\frac{0}{100}\binom{r+l}{2}$ games. 
Similarly, the left-handed players won $\binom{l}{2}+\frac{40}{100}\binom{r+l}{2}$ games. 
Since the number of games won by left-handed players is $40\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players, we have $\binom{r}{2}+\frac{0}{100}\binom{r+l}{2}=\binom{l}{2}+\frac{40}{100}\binom{r+l}{2}$. 
Substituting our values for $r$ and $l$, we have $\binom{r}{2}+\frac{0}{100}\binom{3r}{2}=\binom{2r}{2}+\frac{40}{100}\binom{3r}{2}$. 
Simplifying, we get $\binom{r}{2}=\frac{40}{100}\binom{3r}{2}$. 
Multiplying both sides by $\frac{100}{40}$, we have $\frac{100}{40}\binom{r}{2}=\binom{3r}{2}$. 
Simplifying, we get $2\binom{r}{2}=\binom{3r}{2}$. 
Expanding, we have $r(r-1)=\frac{3r(3r-1)}{2}$. 
Expanding and simplifying, we get $2r^2-2r=\frac{9r^2-3r}{2}$. 
Multiplying both sides by $2$ and dividing by $r$, we have $4r-4=9r-3$. 
Subtracting $4r$ and adding $3$ to both sides, we get $1=5r$. 
Dividing both sides by $5$, we have $r=\frac{1}{5}$. 
Since $r$ represents the number of right-handed players, we cannot have a fraction of a player, so our assumption that there are twice as many left-handed players as right-handed players was incorrect. 
Thus, we have no solution, so our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 15}$.

Model Answer #2: Let $n$ be the number of right-handed players and $m$ be the number of left-handed players. The number of games won by left-handed players is $\binom{m}{2}$ and the number of games won by right-handed players is $\binom{n}{2}$. We are given that \[\binom{m}{2}=\binom{n}{2}\cdot\frac{140}{100}.\] We are also given that $2n=m$, so \[\binom{2n}{2}=\binom{n}{2}\cdot\frac{240}{100}.\] Simplifying this equation yields $4n^2 - 6n = n^2 - n$ and $3n^2 - 5n = 0$. Therefore, $n=0$ or $n=\dfrac{5}{3}$. Since $n$ is an integer, we have $n=0$. Since there are $m$ left-handed players and $2n=0$ left-handed players, we have $m=0$, so there are no players at all. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{0}$.

Model Final Answer #3: A
Model Answer #3: Let $r$ be the number of right-handed players and $l$ be the number of left-handed players. Since every game consists of a right-handed player and a left-handed player, there were a total of $rl$ games. Since every player plays every other player exactly once, the total number of games won by right-handed players and left-handed players combined is $\binom{r}{2} + \binom{l}{2} = \frac{r(r-1)}{2} + \frac{l(l-1)}{2}$.
The total number of games won by left-handed players is $40\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players, so $\frac{l(l-1)}{2} = \frac{140}{100} \cdot \frac{r(r-1)}{2}$. Simplifying, we have $l(l-1) = \frac{7}{5} \cdot r(r-1)$.
Since there were twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, $r=2l$. We substitute this into the equation above to get $l(l-1) = \frac{7}{5} \cdot 2l(2l-1) = \frac{7}{5} \cdot 2l(4l-1)$. Simplifying, we find $l-1 = \frac{14}{5} \cdot (2l-1)$, so $5l - 5 = 28l - 14$, which gives $l = 1$.
Substituting $l=1$ into $r=2l$, we find $r=2$.
The number of games won by left-handed players is $\frac{l(l-1)}{2} = \frac{1(0)}{2} = 0$, and the number of games won by right-handed players is $\frac{r(r-1)}{2} = \frac{2(1)}{2} = 1$.
Therefore, the total number of games played is $0 + 1 = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }15}$.

Model Final Answer #4: abstain
Model Answer #4: Let $r$ be the total number of right-handed players, so $2r$ is the total number of left-handed players, and the total number of players is $3r$.  Each player played $3r-1$ games, so the total number of games played is $(3r)(3r-1)$.  Since the number of games won by left-handed players was $40\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players, the number of games won by left-handed players was $\frac{140}{100}$ times the number of games won by right-handed players.  Therefore, the number of games won by left-handed players was $\frac{140}{100}$ times $\frac{2}{3}$ of the total number of games played, and the number of games won by right-handed players was $\frac{100}{100}$ times $\frac{1}{3}$ of the total number of games played.  Therefore, $\frac{140}{100}\cdot\frac{2}{3} + \frac{100}{100}\cdot\frac{1}{3} = 1$ is the total number of games won by each player.  Thus, $(3r)(3r-1) = 1\cdot(3r)$, $3r(3r-1) = 3r$, $3r-1 = 1$, so $3r = 2$ and $r=\frac{2}{3}$.  Therefore, $(3r)(3r-1) = \left(3\cdot\frac{2}{3}\right)\left(3\cdot\frac{2}{3}-1\right) = 2\cdot(2-1) = \boxed{2}$.

Model Final Answer #5: E
Model Answer #5: If there are $r$ right-handed players and $l$ left-handed players, then the total number of games played is $\binom{r+l}{2}$. The number of games won by the left-handed players is $\binom{l}{2}+\binom{r}{1}\binom{l}{1}$, which must equal $\frac{7}{5}\binom{r}{2}$, since the number of games won by left-handed players is $40\%$ more than the number won by right-handed players. Solving, we get 
\begin{align*} \frac{7}{5}\binom{r}{2}&=\binom{l}{2}+\binom{r}{1}\binom{l}{1} \\ \Rightarrow \qquad \frac{7r(r-1)}{5}&=\frac{l(l-1)}{2}+rl \\ \Rightarrow \qquad 14r(r-1)&=5l(l-1)+10rl \\ \Rightarrow \qquad 14r^2-14r&=5l^2-5l+10rl \\ \Rightarrow \qquad 14(r^2-r)&=5(l^2-l)+10rl \\ \Rightarrow \qquad 2(r^2-r)&=l^2-l+2rl \\ \Rightarrow \qquad 2r(r-1)&=l(l-1)+2rl \\ \Rightarrow \qquad 0&=l^2-l-2r^2+3r \\ \Rightarrow \qquad 0&=(l-r)(l+2r-3) \end{align*}
Since $r>l$, we must have $l+2r-3=0$, so $l=3-2r$. The total number of games played is then $\binom{r+l}{2}=\binom{4r-3}{2}=\frac{(4r-3)(4r-4)}{2}=\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 66}$.

Model Final Answer #6: B
Model Answer #6: Let $r$ be the number of right-handed players, and let $l$ be the number of left-handed players. We are given that $l=2r$, and that $r$ right-handed players win $40\%$ fewer games than $l$ left-handed players. Let $w_r$ be the number of games won by right-handed players, and let $w_l$ be the number of games won by left-handed players. We are given that $w_l=1.4w_r$. Every game played results in one win for a right-handed player and one win for a left-handed player, so the number of games played is equal to the sum of the number of games won by the right-handed players and the number of games won by the left-handed players, which is \[w_r + w_l = w_r + 1.4w_r = 2.4w_r\]Since there are $l=2r$ left-handed players and $r$ right-handed players, the total number of games played is also equal to $2r\cdot l$, which is \[2r\cdot l = 2r \cdot 2r = 4r^2\]Setting these two expressions equal to each other gives $2.4w_r = 4r^2$. We know that $w_r + 1.4w_r = 2.4w_r$, so we substitute $2.4w_r$ for $w_r + w_l$ in the equation, which gives $w_r + 1.4w_r = 4r^2$. Thus, $2.4w_r = 4r^2$, which gives $w_r = \frac{5}{3}r^2$. Since $w_r$ is a positive integer (the number of games won by right-handed players), then $r$ must be a multiple of $3$. The smallest multiple of $3$ that makes $w_r$ an integer is $r=3$. In this case, $w_r = \frac{5}{3}(3^2) = 5(3) = 15$. Thus, the number of games played is $2.4w_r = 2.4(15) = 36$, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }36}$.

Model Final Answer #7: A
Model Answer #7: Let the total number of right-handed players be $2r$ and the total number of left-handed players be $l$. We can create a chart with $2r$ rows and $l$ columns, since each right-handed player plays each left-handed player. There are $2rl$ total games.
Let's look at a single column of the chart, with $2r$ rows. Since each participant plays every other participant exactly once, the total number of wins in that column is $\frac{2r}{2} = r$, since there are $2r$ total games and each person wins exactly once. Similarly, in a single row, with $l$ columns, the total number of wins is $l$.
The number of games won by left-handed players is $40\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players, so $l = 1.4r$. Substituting into the chart gives a chart with $2r$ rows and $1.4r$ columns. There are $2r \times 1.4r = 2.8r^2$ total games.
Since each game is counted twice in $2.8r^2$, the total number of games is $\frac{2.8r^2}{2} = 1.4r^2$.
Finally, we notice that $r=3$ is a solution, since the number of wins by left-handed players is $1.4 \times 3 = 4.2$ and the number of wins by right-handed players is $3$, which is $40\%$ less than $4.2$. This yields $1.4 \times 3^2 = 1.4 \times 9 = 12.6 \approx 13$ games, so the total number of games is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }15}$.

Model Final Answer #8: abstain
Model Answer #8: Let $r$ be the number of right-handed players and let $l$ be the number of left-handed players. Since every participant played every other participant exactly once, the number of games played is the number of pairs of players, which is $rl$. The number of games won by left-handed players is $\frac{r}{l} \cdot 1\left(\frac{rl}{2}\right) = \frac{r^2l}{2}$ and the number of games won by right-handed players is $1\left(\frac{rl}{2}\right) = \frac{rl}{2}$, so $\frac{r^2l}{2} = \frac{rl}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{rl}{2} + \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{rl}{2}\right)$. Dividing both sides by $\frac{rl}{2}$ and simplifying gives $r = \frac{12}{5}$. Plugging this into $rl$ shows that the total number of games played is $\frac{12}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{2} = \boxed{18}$.

Model Final Answer #9: A
Model Answer #9: Let $x$ be the number of left-handed people and let $y$ be the number of right-handed people. It follows that the lefties won $1.4xy$ games and the righties won $xy$ games. Therefore, we have the equation $1.4xy=xy\cdot\frac{(x+y-1)}{2}$. Simplifying yields $\frac32(x-y)=x+y-1$, so $\frac12x=\frac52y-\frac12$. Since $x$ and $y$ must be positive integers, the smallest possible values for $x$ and $y$ are $3$ and $1$ respectively, and the answer is $3\cdot1\cdot\frac52\cdot\frac12=\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 15}$.

Model Final Answer #10: abstain
Model Answer #10: Since the number of games won by left-handed players was $40 \%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players, the ratio of games left-handed won to games right-handed won is $1.4$, which is equal to $\frac{7}{5}$. (If this doesn't seem intuitive, just test random numbers.)
Let $l$ equal the number of left-handed players and $r$ equal the number of right-handed players. We need to find $l + r$. From the ratio above, we can create the equation $\frac{l}{r}=\frac{7}{5}$.
Since there were twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, we can create another equation $r=2l$.
Substituting $r=2l$ into $\frac{l}{r}=\frac{7}{5}$, we get $\frac{l}{2l}=\frac{7}{5}$. Solving, we find $l=\frac{10}{7}$. 
Since $l$ must be an integer, we find $l=10$ and $r=20$. 
Each left-handed player played $20$ games and won $\frac{7}{12}$ of them. Therefore, the number of games won by left-handed players is $20 \cdot \frac{7}{12} = \frac{35}{3}$. 
Each right-handed player played $10$ games and won $\frac{5}{12}$ of them. Therefore, the number of games won by right-handed players is $20 \cdot \frac{5}{12} = \frac{25}{3}$.
The total number of games played is the sum of the games won by left-handed and right-handed players, or $\frac{35}{3} + \frac{25}{3} = \frac{60}{3} = \boxed{20}$.

What is the perimeter of $\triangle{APQ}$? $A)  84  B)  86  C)  88  D)  90  E)  92$
Solution: A
Model Final Answer #1: B
Model Answer #1: Let $BP = x$. Then $AP = x+2$ (because $AB = 30$ and $ABP$ is a $3:4:5$ triangle) and $CP=28-x$. $AQ$ is then $30-(x+2) = 28-x$, and $QD = x+2$. Therefore, $AP + PQ + QA = (x+2) + PQ + (28-x) = 30$, and $PQ = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }86}$.
Note: This solution assumes that $P$ and $Q$ are chosen on the exterior of the rectangle.

Model Final Answer #2: D
Model Answer #2: The side lengths of $\triangle{ABP}$ are $28,$ $m,$ and $n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers. Note that $m \neq n$ because $AB \neq AP.$ By the triangle inequality, we have $2n > 28,$ $2m > 28,$ and $m + n > 30.$

By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $n^2 + m^2 = 30^2 = 900.$ The only pairs of positive integers $\{m,n\}$ such that $m \neq n$ and $n^2 + m^2 = 900$ are $\{18,24\}$ and $\{15,25\}.$

If $n = 18$ and $m = 24,$ then $2n = 36 < 28,$ contradiction. Therefore, $n = 15$ and $m = 25.$

The perimeter of $\triangle{APQ}$ is $AP + PQ + AQ = 25 + AD + 15 = 40 + AD = \boxed{90}.$

Model Final Answer #3: A
Model Answer #3: Let $BP = x$. Then, let $AQ = y$ and $PD = 28 - y$.
By the Pythagorean Theorem, the integer lengths of the sides of $\triangle{ABP}$, $\triangle{PCQ}$, and $\triangle{QDA}$ are $\sqrt{900 - x^2}$, $\sqrt{784 + x^2}$, $\sqrt{900 - (28 - y)^2}$, respectively.
Since $\triangle{APQ}$ is a right triangle, we use the Pythagorean Theorem to find that $x^2 + y^2 = (28 - y)^2$. Simplifying gives us $y = \frac{784}{56}$, or $y = 14$.
Then, $x = 2$.
Therefore, the perimeter of $\triangle{APQ}$ is $30 + 14 + 2 = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }84}$.

Model Final Answer #4: C
Model Answer #4: Let $x$ and $y$ be the lengths of $PC$ and $PQ$, respectively. Using the Law of Cosines, we have:
\begin{align} y^2 + 28^2 - 2(28)(y \cos{\angle{PCQ}}) = x^2 \\ 30^2 + x^2 - 2(30)(x \cos{\angle{PCQ}}) = y^2 \end{align}
We also know that $x^2 + y^2 = 58^2$. Rearranging the above equations yields $y = 784/x$. Now, we must find a value of $x$ such that $x^2 + 614656/x^2 = 58^2$. Simplifying the equation, we have $x^4 - 3364x^2 + 614656 = 0$. The equation factors into:
\[(x^2 - 784)(x^2 - 784) = 0\]
Thus $x = \pm 28$, since $x$ must be positive, $x = 28$. Thus, $y = 28$. Now, we know that $\triangle APQ$ is a 7-24-25 triangle, so the perimeter is $7 + 24 + 25 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 88}$

Let $AP=a$, $BP=b$, $PQ=x$, $AQ=y$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have
\[a^2+b^2=900\]
\[b^2+(x+y)^2=784\]
\[a^2+(x+y)^2=784\]
Since $a^2+b^2=a^2+(x+y)^2$, we have $b^2=(x+y)^2=900$. Therefore $y=20$ and $x=8$.
Hence the perimeter of $\triangle APQ$ is $a+b+x+y=30+20+8=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }90}$.

Model Final Answer #6: A
Model Answer #6: Let $BP=x$, $CQ = y$, $PQ=z$. Notice that $AP = 30-x$, $AQ = 28-y$. Using the Law of Cosines on $\triangle ABP$ and $\triangle PCQ$,
\begin{align*} 30^2 + (30-x)^2 - 2\cdot 30 \cdot (30-x) \cos \angle APB &= x^2 \\ 28^2 + (28-y)^2 - 2\cdot 28 \cdot (28-y) \cos \angle CQP &= y^2 \end{align*}
which can be rewritten as
\begin{align*} 1800 - 60x &= -2x^2 \\ 952 - 56y &= -2y^2 \end{align*}
Dividing by 2 gives
\begin{align*} x^2 - 30x + 900 &= 0 \\ y^2 - 28y + 476 &= 0 \end{align*}
In order for $z$ to be an integer, $x$ and $y$ must be integers. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, the discriminants of both of the above equations must be perfect squares.
We can test perfect squares using difference of squares factorization.
$x^2 - 30x + 900 = (x-15)^2 - 225$
$y^2 - 28y + 476 = (y-14)^2 - 100$
Thus, $(x-15)^2 = 325$ and $(y-14)^2 =100$. Testing the first equation using $x=15 \pm 5\sqrt{13}$, we find no solutions that are integers. However, testing the second equation yields $y = 9, 19$. Since $y = 9$ does not work, $y = 19$ is the only valid solution.
Thus, $AP = 30 - x = 30 - 15 = 15$ and $AQ = 28 - y = 28 - 19 = 9$. The perimeter of $\triangle APQ$ is $AP + AQ + PQ = 15 + 9 + z$. $z$ must be an integer because $AP = 15$, $AQ = 9$, and $BC = 28$ are integers, so the perimeter of $\triangle APQ$ must be $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 84}$.

Model Final Answer #7: A
Model Answer #7: We can deduce that $\triangle{ABP}\sim\triangle{PCQ}\sim\triangle{QDA}$ because of $\angle{ABP}=\angle{PCQ}=\angle{QDA}=90^{\circ}$.
Let $AP=a$, $BP=b$, $BQ=c$, $DQ=d$, $DQ=x$. Because $ABCD$ is a rectangle, $AD=BC=28$.
By using the law of cosines,
\begin{align*} a^2+b^2-60ab\cos{\angle{ABP}}&=784,\\ b^2+c^2-56bc\cos{\angle{PCQ}}&=784,\\ c^2+d^2-58cd\cos{\angle{QDA}}&=784. \end{align*}
Obviously, $\cos{\angle{ABP}},\cos{\angle{PCQ}},\cos{\angle{QDA}}$ are all rational numbers. Therefore, $ab$,$bc$,$cd$ are also all rational numbers.
Because $AB=30$, $AP=a=\frac{28^2+30^2-784}{60\cdot28}=\frac{35}{3}$, $PB=28-\frac{35}{3}=\frac{77}{3}$.
Because $BC=28$, $BQ=c=\frac{28^2+d^2-784}{58\cdot28}=\frac{d^2}{58}-\frac{3}{2}d+\frac{35}{2}$.
Because $CD=x$, $DQ=d=\frac{28^2+x^2-784}{56\cdot28}=\frac{x^2}{56}-\frac{x}{2}+7$.
Let $DQ=d=\frac{a}{b}$. $a^2+b^2=784+60ab\cos{\angle{ABP}}=784+60ab\cdot\frac{28^2+30^2-784}{60\cdot28}=28^2+30^2$, $a^2+b^2=28^2+30^2$.
We can deduce that $a$ and $b$ are both positive integers. We can use the same method to deduce that $c$ and $d$ are both positive integers.
The perimeter of $\triangle{APQ}$ is $a+b+c+d=28+\frac{35}{3}+\frac{28^2+d^2-784}{58\cdot28}+\frac{28^2+x^2-784}{56\cdot28}=28+\frac{35}{3}+\frac{28^2+\frac{a^2}{b^2}-784}{58\cdot28}+\frac{28^2+\frac{x^2}{56}-\frac{x}{2}+7-784}{56\cdot28}=28+\frac{35}{3}+\frac{28^2+\frac{a^2}{b^2}-784}{58\cdot28}+\frac{28^2+\frac{a^2}{4}-\frac{a}{2}+7-784}{56\cdot28}$.
We know that $a^2+b^2=28^2+30^2$. Therefore, $a=\frac{35}{3}$, $b=\frac{77}{3}$.
The perimeter of $\triangle{APQ}$ is $84$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}  84}$.

Model Final Answer #8: A
Model Answer #8: By the Pythagorean Theorem, $AP = \sqrt{AB^2 + BP^2} = \sqrt{900 + BP^2}$, $PQ = \sqrt{BP^2 + CQ^2}$, and $AQ = \sqrt{CQ^2 + DA^2} = \sqrt{CQ^2 + 900}$, where $BP < 30$ and $CQ < 28$. Hence $AP$, $PQ$, and $AQ$ are all integers if and only if $BP^2 + 900$, $BP^2 + CQ^2$, and $CQ^2 + 900$ are all perfect squares.
Let $BP^2 + 900 = x^2$, $BP^2 + CQ^2 = y^2$, and $CQ^2 + 900 = z^2$. Then $y^2 - x^2 = (y - x)(y + x) = CQ^2 - 900$. Since $CQ < 28$, we have $(y - x,y + x) = (CQ^2 - 900,CQ^2 + 900) = (z - CQ^2 + 900,z + CQ^2 - 900) = (2z - 1800,2z) = (2(z - 900),2z) = 2(z - 900)(z)$. Hence $y - x = 2(z - 900)$ and $y + x = 2z$. Adding these equations gives $2y = 2z + 2(z - 900) = 4z - 1800$, so $z = \frac{2y + 1800}{4} = \frac{y + 900}{2}$. Hence $y + 900 = 2z$ is even, so $y$ is odd.
Since $y - x = 2(z - 900)$, $y$ and $x$ have the same parity, so $x$ is also odd. Let $y = 2n + 1$ and $x = 2m + 1$ for some integers $n$ and $m$. Then $CQ^2 - 900 = y^2 - x^2 = (2n + 1)^2 - (2m + 1)^2 = 4(n - m)(n + m + 1)$, so $(n - m)(n + m + 1)$ is a multiple of $225$. Hence $n - m$ and $n + m + 1$ are both multiples of $3$, and $n + m + 1 - (n - m) = 2m + 1$ is a multiple of $3$. Hence $m = 3a + 1$ for some integer $a$, so $BP^2 = x^2 - 900 = (2m + 1)^2 - 900 = (6a + 3)^2 - 900 = 36a^2 + 36a + 9 - 900 = 36(a^2 + a - 22)$. Hence $a^2 + a - 22$ is a perfect square, so $(a - 11)^2 = a^2 + a - 22 + 121$ is a perfect square, so $a^2 + a + 99 = (a + 1)^2 + 99$ is a perfect square. Since $99 = 9 \times 11$ and $11$ is prime, this is only possible if $a + 1 \in \{1,3,9\}$. We find that $a = 0$ and $a = 8$ both work, so $m = 1$ and $m = 25$ both work.
If $m = 1$, then $BP = 6a + 3 = 9$, so $AP = \sqrt{900 + 81} = 3\sqrt{101}$ and $AQ = \sqrt{CQ^2 + 900} = \sqrt{(2z)^2 + 900} = \sqrt{4z^2 + 900} = \sqrt{4(z^2 + 225)} = 2\sqrt{z^2 + 225} = 2\sqrt{y^2 - 900} = 2\sqrt{4(n - m)(n + m + 1)} = 4\sqrt{(n - m)(n + m + 1)} = 4\sqrt{(2n + 1)(2n + 3)}$. Hence $AP$ and $AQ$ are integers if and only if $101$ and $(2n + 1)(2n + 3)$ are both perfect squares. Since $11^2 < 101 < 12^2$, $101$ is not a perfect square, so the only way that $AP$ and $AQ$ can both be integers is if $2n + 1 = 3^2 = 9$, in which case $n = 4$ and $y = 2n + 1 = 9$.
If $m = 25$, then $BP = 6a + 3 = 6 \cdot 8 + 3 = 51$, so $AP = \sqrt{900 + 2601} = \sqrt{3501}$ and $AQ = \sqrt{4n^2 + 900} = \sqrt{4(2z - 1800)^2 + 900} = \sqrt{4(z^2 - 1800z + 810000) + 900} = \sqrt{4z^2 - 7200z + 3240000 + 900} = \sqrt{4z^2 - 7200z + 3240900} = \sqrt{(2z - 1800)^2 + 45^2} = 2z - 1800 + 45 = 2z - 1755$. Hence $AP$ and $AQ$ are integers if and only if $3501$ and $4z^2 - 7200z + 3240900$ are both perfect squares. Since $59^2 < 3501 < 60^2$, $3501$ is not a perfect square, so the only way that $AP$ and $AQ$ can both be integers is if $2z - 1755 = 60^2 = 3600$, in which case $z = 2677$ and $CQ = \frac{z}{2} = 1338$. Hence $AP = \sqrt{3501} = 59$ and $AQ = 2z - 1755 = 3600 - 1755 = 1845$, so the perimeter of $\triangle{APQ}$ is $AP + PQ + AQ = 59 + 51 + 1845 = 1955 = \boxed{084}$.

Model Final Answer #9: C
Model Answer #9: Let $AP=x$. By the Pythagorean theorem, $BP=2\sqrt{15^2-x^2}$. $CQ$ can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem: $CQ = \sqrt{28^2-(28-2\sqrt{15^2-x^2})^2} =  \sqrt{28^2-(784-112\sqrt{15^2-x^2}+60^2-4x^2)} = \sqrt{16x^2-112\sqrt{15^2-x^2}+1000}$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $DQ = \sqrt{30^2-(30-2\sqrt{15^2-x^2})^2} = \sqrt{900-(900-120\sqrt{15^2-x^2}+4x^2)} = \sqrt{16x^2-120\sqrt{15^2-x^2}+900}$. $APQ$ is a right triangle, and $PQ$ can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem: $PQ = \sqrt{x^2+\left(\sqrt{16x^2-112\sqrt{15^2-x^2}+1000}+\sqrt{16x^2-120\sqrt{15^2-x^2}+900}\right)^2}$. Because all the side lengths are integers, we know that $\sqrt{16x^2-112\sqrt{15^2-x^2}+1000}$ and $\sqrt{16x^2-120\sqrt{15^2-x^2}+900}$ must be integers. Let $y=\sqrt{15^2-x^2}$; then, $\sqrt{16x^2-112\sqrt{15^2-x^2}+1000} = \sqrt{16y^2-112y+1000}$ and $\sqrt{16x^2-120\sqrt{15^2-x^2}+900} = \sqrt{16y^2-120y+900}$. Because $\sqrt{16y^2-120y+900}$ is an integer, we know that $120y$ is divisible by $8$. Therefore, $y$ is divisible by $2$. Let $y=2z$. Because $\sqrt{16y^2-112y+1000}$ is an integer and $y$ is divisible by $2$, we know that $112y-1000$ is divisible by $4$. Therefore, $z$ is odd. We can find the possible values of $z$ by listing the possible values of $\sqrt{16z^2-112z+1000}$: $11, 13, 17, 19$. Therefore, $z = 5$ because $z$ is odd. Plugging $z$ back into $y=2z$, we find that $y=10$. Plugging $y$ back into $x^2+y^2=15^2$, we find that $x=15$. Plugging $x$ back into $PQ$, we find that $PQ=29$. The perimeter of $APQ$ is $x+y+PQ = 15+10+29 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 88}$.

Model Final Answer #10: B
Model Answer #10: Let $BP = a$, $PC = 28 - a$, $CQ = b$, $QD = 30 - b$, and $AQ = c$.  By the Pythagorean Theorem,
\[a^2 + c^2 = 900,\]$(28 - a)^2 + b^2 = 784$, and
\[b^2 + (30 - c)^2 = 900.\]Hence, the squares of $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are positive integers that add up to 900.

Since $a^2 + c^2 = 900$, $a,$ $c,$ and 30 form a primitive Pythagorean triple.  Also, since $b^2 + (30 - c)^2 = 900$, $b,$ $30 - c,$ and 30 form a primitive Pythagorean triple.  Since $30 - c < 30,$ $c = 29,$ so $a = 20$ and $b = 16.$

Therefore, the perimeter of $\triangle APQ$ is $a + b + c = \boxed{86}.$

18) A rhombic dodecahedron is a solid with $12$ congruent rhombus faces. At every vertex, $3$ or $4$ edges meet, depending on the vertex. How many vertices have exactly $3$ edges meet? $A) 5 B) 6 C) 7 D) 8 E) 9$
Solution: D
Model Final Answer #1: A
Model Answer #1: Every vertex must be a vertex of either $3$ or $4$ rhombi. We use $V$, $E$, and $F$ to denote the number of vertices, edges, and faces, respectively. Let $V_3$ and $V_4$ denote the number of vertices at which $3$ and $4$ edges meet, respectively.  Since $12$ rhombi meet at $V$ vertices, and each vertex is shared by $3$ or $4$ rhombi, we have $\frac{3}{V} + \frac{4}{V} = 12$, which implies $V=2$.
Since $12$ rhombi meet at $E$ edges, and each edge is shared by $2$ rhombi, we have $\frac{2}{E} = 12$, which implies $E=1$.
Thus there are $2$ vertices at which $3$ edges meet, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 5}$.

----

Model Final Answer #2: abstain
Model Answer #2: Let the number of vertices with $3$ edges be $x$. Note that each vertex is shared by three rhombic faces. However, the rhombic dodecahedron has $12$ faces, so $2(x)+4(12-x)=12 \implies 2x + 48 - 4x = 12 \implies -2x = -36 \implies x=\boxed{18}$. (Note: this is not the answer, since the problem asks for the number of vertices with exactly $3$ edges; some of these vertices have more than $3$ edges)

----

Model Final Answer #3: abstain
Model Answer #3: Let $V$ be the number of vertices, $E$ the number of edges and $F$ the number of faces. We know that $F = 12$. Each vertex is the endpoint of $3$ edges, and we count each edge twice (once for each endpoint), so $2E = 3V$. We can rewrite this as $E = \frac{3}{2}V$. Now we can use Euler's formula:
\[V + F = E + 2\]
\[V + 12 = \frac{3}{2}V + 2\]
\[\frac{1}{2}V = 10\]
\[V = 20\]
Thus, $20$ vertices meet $3$ edges, so the answer is $\boxed{20}$.

----

Model Final Answer #4: D
Model Answer #4: Let $E$ be the number of edges, $V$ be the number of vertices, and $F$ be the number of faces. Applying Euler's formula, $V+F=E+2$.
Each rhombus contributes $4$ edges and $4$ vertices, so $4F=2E$. Therefore, $V+F=E+2=2F+2V \Longrightarrow F=2V-2$. 
Let $v$ be the number of vertices with $3$ edges meeting. 
$2F=12 \Longrightarrow F=6$, so $V=8$. 
$3v+4(8-v)=2E=24$, so $v=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }8}$.

----

Model Final Answer #5: B
Model Answer #5: For the same reasons as above, there are $20$ edges in the rhombic dodecahedron.  Each vertex is formed by $3$ edges, and there is a total of $20$ edges, so there are $\frac{20}{3}$ vertices.  Specifically, $\frac{20}{3}$ vertices have exactly $3$ edges meeting.  Since this is not an integer, we round down to get $\boxed{6\text{ (B)}}$.

----

Model Final Answer #6: B
Model Answer #6: The number of vertices with $3$ edges meeting is simply the number of vertices of the graph formed by the rhombic dodecahedron.  A rhombic dodecahedron has $12$ vertices, but we now need to count the degenerate vertices where $4$ edges meet.  Each face of the rhombic dodecahedron is a rhombus, so the total number of edges is $\frac{12 \times 4}{2} = 24$.  We also know that the number of edges at a vertex is equal to the sum of the degrees of the vertices.  Since there are $12$ vertices and $24$ edges, the average degree of each vertex is $\frac{24}{12} = 2$.  Thus, there must be an equal number of vertices with $3$ edges meeting as $4$ edges meeting.  Therefore, there are $\frac{12}{2} = \boxed{6 \text{ (B)}}$ vertices with $3$ edges meeting.

----

Model Final Answer #7: D
Model Answer #7: The total number of edges of the rhombic dodecahedron is $12 \times 4/2 = 24$ (each edge is shared by two faces, so each edge is counted twice). Each vertex is the intersection of three edges, so the number of vertices is $24/3 = 8 \Rightarrow \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 8}$.

----

Model Final Answer #8: abstain
Model Answer #8: Each rhombus is adjacent to $4$ other rhombi.  Also, since the rhombic dodecahedron is convex, exactly three edges meet at each vertex.  Thus, if we let $V$ be the number of vertices, $E$ be the number of edges, and $R$ be the number of rhombi, we have $4R=2E=3V$.  Therefore, $V=\frac{4R}{3}$.  Since each vertex is adjacent to $3$ rhombi, there are $\frac{3R}{2}$ vertices.  Since $R=12$, there are $\frac{3R}{2}=\frac{36}{2}=\boxed{18}$ vertices.

----

Model Final Answer #9: E
Model Answer #9: Let $E$ be the number of edges, $V$ be the number of vertices, and $F$ be the number of faces. By Euler's formula, we have $V + F = E + 2$. Since there are $12$ rhombus faces, there are $24$ diagonals. Since each diagonal corresponds to $2$ edges, we have $E = V + 12$. Also, since each face has $4$ vertices, we have $4F = 2E$. Substituting, we get $24 = 5V + 12$ or $V = 2$. There are $12$ edges per vertex, so there are $\frac{12}{3} = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }9}$ vertices.

----

Model Final Answer #10: B
Model Answer #10: Every edge of the rhombic dodecahedron is part of $2$ rhombi, and there are $12$ rhombi in total.  Therefore, there are $6$ edges.  By the Handshake Lemma, there are $\frac{2 \cdot 6}{2} = 6$ vertices.  Each vertex is adjacent to $3$ edges, so the answer is $\boxed{6}$.

19) The line segment formed by $A(1, 2)$ and $B(3, 3)$ is rotated to the line segment formed by $A'(3, 1)$ and $B'(4, 3)$ about the point $P(r, s)$. What is $|r-s|$? $A)  \frac{1}{4}  B)  \frac{1}{2}  C)  \frac{3}{4}    D)  \frac{2}{3} E) 1$
Solution: E
Model Final Answer #1: E
Model Answer #1: We let $(x,y)$ be the image of $(1,2)$ after the rotation, and $(x',y')$ be the image of $(3,3)$ after the rotation. Rotating $(1,2)$ and $(3,3)$ by the same number of degrees, the slope of $\overline{A'B'}$ is the same as the slope of $\overline{AB}$ (because both slopes are equal to the tangent of the angle of rotation). Therefore, we have $\frac{y'-3}{x'-4} = \frac{y-1}{x-3}$. Plugging in the coordinates of $A$ and $B$, we have $\frac{y'-3}{x'-4} = \frac{2-1}{1-3}$, or $\frac{y'-3}{x'-4} = -\frac{1}{2}$. We also know that the midpoint of $\overline{A'B'}$ is $(r,s)$, so $\frac{x'+r}{2} = \frac{y'+s}{2}$. Plugging in the coordinates of $A'$ and $B'$, we have $\frac{3+r}{2} = \frac{1+s}{2}$, or $r+s = -2$. Solving for $r$ and $s$ using the system of equations $\frac{y'-3}{x'-4} = -\frac{1}{2}$ and $r+s = -2$, we find that $r = \frac{3}{4}$ and $s = -\frac{11}{4}$. Therefore, $|r-s| = \left|\frac{3}{4} - \left(-\frac{11}{4}\right)\right| = \boxed{\frac{7}{2}} \Rightarrow \fbox{(E)}$.

Model Answer #2: We first determine what point the line segment is rotated about. The slope of the line $AB$ is $\frac{3-2}{3-1} = \frac{1}{2}$. Suppose that the center of rotation is $(r, s)$. Since the slope of the line segment $A'B'$ is $-\frac{2}{1}$, the slope of the line segment $A'B'$ must be equal to the negative reciprocal of the slope of $AB$, so $\frac{s-1}{r-3} = -2$. Solving, we get $2r-6 = s-1$, so $2r-s = 5$. Thus, $|r-s| = \boxed{5}$

Model Answer #3: Let $P(x, y)$ be the center of rotation.  Let $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ be the position vectors of $A$ and $B,$ respectively.  Then we want to find $\mathbf{p} = \begin{pmatrix} r \\ s \end{pmatrix}$ such that
\[\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{M} (\mathbf{a}' - \mathbf{p}),\]where $\mathbf{M}$ is a rotation matrix.  We can write this as
\[\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{M} (\mathbf{a}' - \mathbf{p}).\]Then
\[\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{M} \mathbf{a}' + \mathbf{M} \mathbf{p}.\]Then
\[(\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{M}) \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{M} \mathbf{a}'.\]Note that $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{M} \mathbf{a}'$ is the vector that takes $\mathbf{a}'$ to $\mathbf{a}$ under the rotation $\mathbf{M}.$  In other words,
\[\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{M} \mathbf{a}' = \mathbf{R} \mathbf{a},\]where $\mathbf{R}$ is the rotation matrix that takes $\mathbf{a}'$ to $\mathbf{a}.$  Then
\[(\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{M}) \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{R} \mathbf{a}.\]In turn, $\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{R}^{-1} (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{M}) \mathbf{p}.$  Since $\mathbf{R}$ is a rotation matrix, $\mathbf{R}^{-1} = \mathbf{R}^T,$ so
\[\mathbf{a} = (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{M}) \mathbf{R}^T \mathbf{p}.\]Then
\[\mathbf{R}^T \mathbf{p} = (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{M})^{-1} \mathbf{a}.\]Since $\mathbf{R}^T$ is also a rotation matrix, $\mathbf{R}^T (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{M})^{-1}$ is a rotation matrix.  This means $\mathbf{R}^T (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{M})^{-1}$ must be of the form
\[\begin{pmatrix} \cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\ \sin \theta & \cos \theta \end{pmatrix}.\]Then the transformation
\[\begin{pmatrix} r \\ s \end{pmatrix} \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} \cos \theta & \sin \theta \\ -\sin \theta & \cos \theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} r \\ s \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} r \cos \theta + s \sin \theta \\ -r \sin \theta + s \cos \theta \end{pmatrix}\]is a rotation about the origin.

Since $\mathbf{a} = (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{M}) \mathbf{R}^T \mathbf{p},$ we can write

\begin{align*}
r \cos \theta + s \sin \theta &= (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{M})^{-1} \mathbf{a}_1, \\
-r \sin \theta + s \cos \theta &= (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{M})^{-1} \mathbf{a}_2.
\end{align*}Since $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix},$ we can write these equations as
\begin{align*}
r \cos \theta + s \sin \theta &= (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{M})^{-1} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}_1, \\
-r \sin \theta + s \cos \theta &= (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{M})^{-1} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}_2.
\end{align*}We can solve these equations to get
\[r = \frac{1}{5} (3 \cos \theta + 2 \sin \theta) \quad \text{and} \quad s = \frac{1}{5} (2 \cos \theta - 3 \sin \theta).\]Then
\[r - s = \frac{1}{5} (3 \cos \theta + 2 \sin \theta) - \frac{1}{5} (2 \cos \theta - 3 \sin \theta) = \frac{1}{5} (5 \sin \theta + 5 \cos \theta) = \frac{1}{5} \sqrt{34},\]so $|r - s| = \boxed{\frac{1}{\sqrt{34}}}.$

Model Final Answer #4: C
Model Answer #4: To make calculations easier, we use the complex plane.  Let $P = 0$.  Then $A = (1 + 2i) - r - si$ and $B = (3 + 3i) - r - si$.  For any complex number $z$, let $\theta_z$ denote the argument of $z$ (i.e. the angle between the positive $x$-axis and the line connecting the origin to $z$).  Now, the rotation of a point $z$ by an angle $\theta$ counterclockwise about the origin is given by $ze^{i\theta}$.  Thus, we seek $\theta$ such that $Ae^{i\theta} = A'$ and $Be^{i\theta} = B'$.  We have \[
Ae^{i\theta} = (1 + 2i - r - si)e^{i\theta} = (3 + i)
\]and\[
Be^{i\theta} = (3 + 3i - r - si)e^{i\theta} = (4 + 3i)
\]Dividing these two equations gives $\frac{1 + 2i - r - si}{3 + 3i - r - si} = \frac{3 + i}{4 + 3i} = \frac{(3 + i)(4 - 3i)}{(4 + 3i)(4 - 3i)} = \frac{15 - 5i}{25} = \frac{3 - i}{5}$.  Cross-multiplying this last equation gives \[
(1 + 2i - r - si)(5) = (3 + 3i - r - si)(3 - i)
\]Expanding each side yields $5 + 10i - 5r - 5si = 9 + 3i - 3r + 9i - 3si - 3r + si$.  Grouping like terms gives $-8i - 2r - 2si + 4 = 0$.  Since $r$ and $s$ are real numbers, we must have $-8i - 2si = 0$, so $s = -\frac{8}{2} = -4$.  Thus $|r - s| = |r + 4| = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{3}{4}}$.

We are rotating $180^\circ$ about $P$. The midpoint $M$ of $AB$ maps to the midpoint $M'$ of $A'B'$. The coordinates of $M$ are $\left(\frac{1+3}{2},\frac{2+3}{2}\right)=\left(\frac52,\frac52\right)$. So the coordinates of $M'$ are $\left(\frac52+2,\frac52-2\right)=\left(\frac92,\frac12\right)$.
We can find the midpoint $P$ of $A'B'$ by rotating $M'$ $90^\circ$ about $A'$ or $B'$. By symmetry, both will give the same point $P$. We can find this point by translating $M'$ by $\frac12\overrightarrow{A'B'}$:
\[\left(\frac92,\frac12\right)+\frac12\left(1-3,2-1\right)=\left(\frac92,\frac12\right)+\left(-1,\frac12\right)=\left(\frac72,1\right)\]

Model Answer #6: The midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ is $M\left(\frac{4}{2}, \frac{5}{2}\right) = M(2, \frac{5}{2})$. The midpoint of $\overline{A'B'}$ is $M'(3.5, 2)$. The point of rotation $P$ is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{A'B'}$. The slope of $\overline{AB}$ is $\frac{\frac{5}{2} - 2}{2 - 1} = \frac{1}{2}$, so the slope of a line perpendicular to $\overline{AB}$ is $-2$. The equation of the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{AB}$ is $y - \frac{5}{2} = -2(x - 2)$, or $y = -2x + 9$. The slope of $\overline{A'B'}$ is $\frac{2 - \frac{5}{2}}{3.5 - 4} = -\frac{1}{2}$, so the slope of a line perpendicular to $\overline{A'B'}$ is $2$. The equation of the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{A'B'}$ is $y - 2 = 2(x - 3.5)$, or $y = 2x - 4$. We set the two equations equal to each other to find $P$.

$-2x + 9 = 2x - 4$
$4x = 13$
$x = \frac{13}{4}$
Substituting $x$ into either equation gives $y = -2\left(\frac{13}{4}\right) + 9 = \frac{11}{2}$, so $P = \left(\frac{13}{4}, \frac{11}{2}\right)$. Thus $|r - s| = \left|\frac{13}{4} - \frac{11}{2}\right| = \left|\frac{13}{4} - \frac{22}{4}\right| = \left|-\frac{9}{4}\right| = \boxed{\frac{9}{4}}$.

Model Final Answer #7: E
Model Answer #7: Let $P$ have coordinates $(r,s)$. We will do some algebra with the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ to find the coordinates of $A'$ and $B'$.
First, we can find the slope of $\overline{AB}$ to be $\frac{3-2}{3-1} = 1$. Therefore, the line on which $A$ and $B$ lie can be written in the form $y = x + b$. Plugging in $(1,2)$, we can solve for $b$ to find that the equation of the line is $y = x + 1$.
Similarly, the slope of $\overline{A'B'}$ is $\frac{3-1}{4-3} = 2$. Plugging in $(3,1)$, we can solve for $b$ to find that the equation of the line is $y = 2x - 5$.
Since $A$ and $A'$ lie on the same line, the equation $y = x + 1$ must hold when we plug in the coordinates of $A'$. Since $A'$ has coordinates $(3,1)$, we have $1 = 3 + 1$, which is not true. Therefore, $A$ and $A'$ cannot lie on the same line.
However, $A$ and $B'$ do lie on the same line. Plugging in the coordinates of $A'$ into $y = 2x - 5$, we find that $1 = 6 - 5$, which is true. Therefore, $A$ and $B'$ do lie on the same line.
Since $A$ and $B'$ lie on the same line, the equation $y = 2x - 5$ must hold when we plug in the coordinates of $B$. Since $B$ has coordinates $(3,3)$, we have $3 = 6 - 5$, which is true. Therefore, $A$ and $B'$ do lie on the same line.
Therefore, the line formed by $A$ and $B$ was rotated about the point $(r,s)$ to form the line $A'$ and $B'$. We can see that the slope of the original line is $1$, while the slope of the new line is $2$. Therefore, the line was rotated $45$ degrees counterclockwise.
We also know that $A$ was rotated to $B'$, so the point $(3,1)$ was rotated to $(4,3)$. We can think of rotating $(3,1)$ $45$ degrees counterclockwise about $(r,s)$ as rotating $(3,1)$ $45$ degrees counterclockwise about the origin $(0,0)$ and then translating the point $(r,s)$ units to the right and $s$ units up. We can do the same with $(4,3)$.
Applying the rotation, we find that $(3,1)$ is transformed into $\left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)$. Applying the translation, we find that $(3,1)$ is transformed into $\left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + r, 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + s\right)$.
We do the same with $(4,3)$ to find that $(4,3)$ is transformed into $\left(3 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + r, 3 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + s\right)$.
We can set the $x$-coordinates equal to each other to find that $1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + r = 3 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + r$. We find that this equation is true for all $r$. Therefore, we cannot find the value of $r$.
However, we can set the $y$-coordinates equal to each other to find that $1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + s = 3 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + s$. We find that this equation is true for all $s$. Therefore, we cannot find the value of $s$.
Since we cannot find the values of $r$ or $s$, we cannot find $|r-s|$. Therefore, our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }1}$.

Model Final Answer #8: B
Model Answer #8: Let's first find the slope of line $AB$: $m_{AB} = \dfrac{3-2}{3-1} = \dfrac12$. Since line $A'B'$ is the image of line $AB$ after rotation, the slope of line $A'B'$ is $-\dfrac{1}{m_{AB}} = -2$. Point $P$ has to be on the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{AB}$, so it can be found by the formula $(\dfrac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \dfrac{y_1+y_2}{2})$. Plugging in the values, we get $P(\dfrac{1+3}{2}, \dfrac{2+3}{2}) = (2, \dfrac{5}{2})$. Thus $|r-s| = |2-\dfrac{5}{2}| = \dfrac12 \Longrightarrow \boxed{\mathrm{(B)}\ \frac{1}{2}}$.

Thus, the coordinates of $P$ is the average of the coordinates of $A$ and $B$, which is $\left(\frac{4}{2}, \frac{5}{2}\right)=\left(2, \frac{5}{2}\right)$. Thus $|r-s|=\left|2-\frac{5}{2}\right|=\boxed{\frac{3}{2}}$.

The midpoint of $\overline{A'B'}$ is $\left(\frac{3+4}{2}, \frac{1+3}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{7}{2}, 2\right)$.  Therefore, the point of rotation, $P$, must be $(2, \frac{5}{2})$.  The distance between $r$ and $s$ is $2 - \frac{5}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$, so the answer is $\boxed{\text{(B)}}$.

20) Each square in a $3\times3$ grid of squares is colored red, white, blue, or green so that every $2\times2$ square contains one square of each color. An example coloring is: BRB, GWG, RBR. How many different colorings are possible? $A) 24 B) 48 C) 60 D) 72 E) 96$
Solution: D
Model Final Answer #1: abstain
Model Answer #1: Imagine that the $3\times3$ grid is numbered like a phone pad: \[\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 2 & 3 \\4 & 5 & 6 \\7 & 8 & 9 \end{array}\]
Let's consider the number of ways to color the first $2\times2$ square. We have four choices for the color of square 1, three choices for the color of square 2, and two choices for the color of square 4. However, we cannot choose the same color for squares 1 and 2 or for squares 1 and 4. So, there are $4\cdot3\cdot2 - 2 = 22$ choices for colors for the first $2\times2$ square.
We can then color the second $2\times2$ square in $4\cdot3\cdot2 - 2 = 22$ ways. Finally, we will color the square in the center.
Since the center square touches each of the $2\times2$ squares, its color will be determined by the color of the other eight squares. So, there are $\boxed{22}$ possible colorings for the whole grid.

Therefore there are $4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = \boxed{4}$ colorings possible.

Model Final Answer #3: D
Model Answer #3: We will use complementary counting. There are a total of $4^9 = 2^{18}$ possible colorings of the $3\times3$ grid of squares. Now, we will count the number of colorings in which there exists a $2\times2$ square with three colors. Call this coloring bad.
Imagine we divide the $3\times3$ grid into nine $1\times1$ grids. Note that for a coloring to be bad, there must be four $1\times1$ grids each with a different color.
We proceed with casework. There are two cases: there are $0$ diagonals or $2$ diagonals.
Case 1: $0$ diagonals.
In this case, we realize that the coloring has to be of the form:
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline W & R & G \\ \hline B & ? & ? \\ \hline ? & ? & ? \\ \hline \end{array}\]
where ? denotes a blank.
We have $3$ choices for the first color, $2$ choices for the second color, and $2$ choices for the third color. We can permute the three colors in $3! = 6$ ways. This gives us a total of $3\cdot2\cdot2\cdot6 = 72$ colorings.
Case 2: $2$ diagonals.
In this case, we realize that the coloring has to be of the form:
\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline W & R & ? \\ \hline B & G & ? \\ \hline ? & ? & ? \\ \hline \end{array}\]
Note that the $?$ in the bottom right corner cannot be colored. We have $3$ choices for the first color, $2$ choices for the second color, and $1$ choice for the third color. We can permute the three colors in $3! = 6$ ways. This gives us a total of $3\cdot2\cdot 1\cdot 6 = 36$ colorings.
The total number of bad colorings is $72 + 36 = 108.$ Therefore, the answer is $2^{18} - 108 = 2^{18} - 2^2 \cdot 3^3 = 4(2^{16} - 9) = 4(65536-9) = 4 \cdot 65527 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) } 72}.$

There are $4$ possible choices for $A$. Suppose $A$ is red. Then there are $2$ possible choices for $B$ (blue and green), and after $B$ is chosen there is $1$ possible choice each for $C$ and $D$. Thus there are $4 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 8$ colorings where $A$ is red. The same is true for green, blue, and white. Hence there are $4 \cdot 8 = 32$ colorings for the case where $A$ is red.
Suppose $A$ is white. (We can assume $A$ is a particular color because the cases are symmetric.) Then $B$ must be blue or green (both cannot be red). There are $2$ possible choices for $B$, and after $B$ is chosen there is $1$ possible choice each for $C$ and $D$. Thus there are $4 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 8$ colorings where $A$ is white. The same is true for green, blue, and red. Hence there are $4 \cdot 8 = 32$ colorings for the case where $A$ is white.
In total there are $32 + 32 = \boxed{64}$ colorings.

Model Answer #5: Suppose that we color the boxes in the following way:
$\begin{tabular}[b]{|c|c|c|} \hline R & R & B\\ \hline G & G & W\\ \hline B & W & B\\ \hline \end{tabular}$
Notice that we can pick any of the first three colors for the top left box, and any of the remaining two for the top middle box. Thus, there are $3\cdot2=6$ ways to color the top row.
Furthermore, once we have colored the top row, the rest of the boxes are determined. This is because the top middle box and the top right box determine the middle left box, the top right box and the bottom left box determine the middle right box, and the middle left box, the middle right box, and the bottom left box determine the bottom right box.
Thus, the answer is $6\cdot1=\boxed{\textbf{(A) }24}$.

Model Answer #6: We do casework on the two corners of the central box that are diagonally opposite.
If they are the same color, then there are two cases (the colors of the other two corners can be chosen in $3$ ways):
$\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline R & W & \\ \hline G & B & \\ \hline  &  & \\ \hline \end{tabular}$ or $\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline R & W & \\ \hline B & G & \\ \hline  &  & \\ \hline \end{tabular}$. In the first case, there are $2$ possible $2 \times 2$ colorings once we have the corners, and in the second case, there are $4,$ so $2\cdot 3 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 36$ possibilities.
If they are different colors:
$\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline R & W & \\ \hline B & G & \\ \hline  &  & \\ \hline \end{tabular}$ or $\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline R & W & \\ \hline G & B & \\ \hline  &  & \\ \hline \end{tabular}$. In the first case, there are $2$ possible $2 \times 2$ colorings once we have the corners, and in the second case, there are $4,$ so $2\cdot 3 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 36$ possibilities.
Thus the answer is $36+36 = \boxed{72}$.

Model Final Answer #7: D
Model Answer #7: We proceed by cases.
Case 1: Two adjacent squares in the middle column are the same color.
There are $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 36$ ways to choose the colors of the three squares in the middle column. For each of these choices, we may choose the colors of the three squares in the right column in $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 6$ ways. The left column is determined by the middle and right columns. Thus, there are $36 \cdot 6 = 216$ ways for this case.
Case 2: Two adjacent squares in the middle row are the same color.
By symmetry, this case has the same number of possibilities as Case 1, or $216$ ways.
Case 3: The four corners are all the same color.
There are $4$ ways to choose which of the four colors will be the color of the corners. The middle square is determined by the corners, so there are no choices for it. The remaining two squares in the middle row and the remaining square in the middle column are determined by the corners and middle square. Thus, there are $4$ ways for this case.
Case 4: The center square is the same color as the four edges.
There are $4$ ways to choose which of the four colors will be the color of the center. Each of the remaining squares in the middle column is determined by the center and the corresponding square in the left column, so there are no choices for them. The remaining two squares in the middle row are determined by the center and the corresponding square in the top row, so there are no choices for them. Thus, there are $4$ ways for this case.
Case 5: The four edges are all the same color, but different from the center.
There are $4$ ways to choose which of the four colors will be the color of the edges. The remaining two squares in the middle row are determined by the edges and the corresponding squares in the top row. Thus, there are $4$ ways for this case.
In total, there are $216 + 216 + 4 + 4 + 4 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }72}$ ways.

Model Final Answer #8: abstain
Model Answer #8: We will count the number of colorings using casework. We note that the top-left $2\times 2$ square must have one square of each color. We now consider the top-right square. It must have the same color as the bottom-left square. Therefore, we can have WWWW, BBBB, RRRR, or GGGG. However, we cannot have the top-left $2\times 2$ square and the top-right $2\times 2$ square have the same color (otherwise, the bottom-right $2\times 2$ square will not have all four colors). So, we have four cases.

The first case is WWWW. We have 2 choices for the bottom-left square (B or G). We then have 2 choices for the top-middle square (R or G). We then have 2 choices for the bottom-middle square (R or B). This gives us $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8$ colorings. 

The second case is BBBB. We have 2 choices for the bottom-left square (R or G). We then have 2 choices for the top-middle square (R or G). We then have 2 choices for the bottom-middle square (R or G). This gives us $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8$ colorings. 

The third case is RRRR. We have 2 choices for the bottom-left square (B or G). We then have 1 choice for the top-middle square (B). We then have 1 choice for the bottom-middle square (G). This gives us $2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 2$ colorings. 

The fourth case is GGGG. We have 2 choices for the bottom-left square (R or B). We then have 1 choice for the top-middle square (R). We then have 1 choice for the bottom-middle square (B). This gives us $2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 2$ colorings. 

Therefore, we have $8+8+2+2 = \boxed{20}$ total colorings, or answer choice $\boxed{\textbf{(F)}\ 20}$.

Model Final Answer #9: B
Model Answer #9: We can think of filling in the $2\times 2$ squares first.  Since there are only $3$ squares in the $2\times 2$ square, each square must be a different color from the other two squares.  We have $4$ choices for the color of the square in the upper left, $3$ choices for the color of the square in the upper right, and $2$ choices for the color of the square in the lower left.  This gives us a total of $4\cdot3\cdot2=24$ possibilities for each $2\times 2$ square.

Once we have filled in the $2\times 2$ squares, there are $2$ choices for the color of the remaining square in the lower right corner.  Therefore, there is a total of $24\cdot 2=\boxed{48}$ possible colorings.

Model Final Answer #10: B
Model Answer #10: Let's imagine a $2 \times 2$ grid.
[asy] draw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2)--cycle); draw((1,0)--(1,2)); draw((0,1)--(2,1)); [/asy]
We can see that there are $4!$ ways to order the colors, but since the grid can be rotated $4$ ways, we divide by $4$ to get $6$ ways to color the $2 \times 2$ grid. Therefore, there are $6^4 = 1296$ ways to color the entire $3 \times 3$ grid. But some of these are rotations of each other. There are $4$ ways to rotate the $3 \times 3$ grid $90^{\circ}$, so we divide by $4$ to get $\dfrac{1296}{4} = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }48}$ ways.

21) Let $P(x)$ be the unique polynomial of minimal degree with the following properties: $P(x)$ has a leading coefficient $1$, $1$ is a root of $P(x)-1$, $2$ is a root of $P(x-2)$, $3$ is a root of $P(3x)$, and $4$ is a root of $4P(x)$.

What is $m+n$? $A) 41 B) 43 C) 45 D) 47 E) 49$
Solution: D
Model Final Answer #1: E
Model Answer #1: Let $P(x) = x^k + c_{k-1}x^{k-1}+\cdots+c_1x+c_0$. We know that $P(1) = 1$, so $1 + c_{k-1} + c_{k-2} + \cdots + c_1 + c_0 = 1$, which means $c_{k-1} + c_{k-2} + \cdots + c_1 + c_0 = 0$. 
We know that $P(2) = 0$, so $2^k + 2c_{k-1} + 2c_{k-2} + \cdots + 2c_1 + c_0 = 0$, which means $2^k + c_{k-1} + c_{k-2} + \cdots + c_1 + c_0 = 0$. 
We also know that $P(3x) = 0$, so $(3x)^k + c_{k-1}(3x)^{k-1} + \cdots + c_1(3x) + c_0 = 0$. We can factor out a $3^k$ to get $3^k(x^k + \frac{c_{k-1}}{3}x^{k-1} + \cdots + \frac{c_1}{3}x + \frac{c_0}{3^k}) = 0$. We know that $3^k$ cannot be $0$, so $x^k + \frac{c_{k-1}}{3}x^{k-1} + \cdots + \frac{c_1}{3}x + \frac{c_0}{3^k} = 0$. Since $P(x)$ has integral coefficients, $\frac{c_{k-1}}{3}, \frac{c_{k-2}}{3}, \cdots, \frac{c_1}{3}, \frac{c_0}{3^k}$ must all be integers. 
We know that $4P(x) = 0$, so $4(x^k + c_{k-1}x^{k-1} + \cdots + c_1x + c_0) = 0$, which means $4x^k + 4c_{k-1}x^{k-1} + \cdots + 4c_1x + 4c_0 = 0$, or $4x^k = -4c_{k-1}x^{k-1} - \cdots - 4c_1x - 4c_0$. We can factor out a $4$ from the right side to get $4x^k = -4(c_{k-1}x^{k-1} + \cdots + c_1x + c_0)$. Since $P(x)$ has integral coefficients, $c_{k-1}, c_{k-2}, \cdots, c_1, c_0$ must all be divisible by $4$. 
Since $P(x)$ has integral coefficients, $c_{k-1}, c_{k-2}, \cdots, c_1, c_0$ must all be integers. Since $c_{k-1} + c_{k-2} + \cdots + c_1 + c_0 = 0$, $c_{k-1} = -c_{k-2} - \cdots - c_1 - c_0$. Since $c_{k-1}$ is divisible by $4$, $c_{k-2} + \cdots + c_1 + c_0$ must also be divisible by $4$, so $c_{k-2} = -c_{k-3} - \cdots - c_1 - c_0$. Continuing this pattern, we get that $c_{k-1}, c_{k-2}, \cdots, c_1, c_0$ are all divisible by $4$. Since $P(4) = 0$, we know that $4^k + 4c_{k-1} + 4c_{k-2} + \cdots + 4c_1 + c_0 = 0$. We can factor out a $4^k$ to get $4^k + c_{k-1} + c_{k-2} + \cdots + c_1 + c_0 = 0$. We know that $c_{k-1} + c_{k-2} + \cdots + c_1 + c_0 = 0$, so $4^k = 0$, which is a contradiction. 
Therefore, $P(x)$ must have a degree of at least $1$. Let $P(x) = x(x-a)Q(x)$, where $Q(x)$ has a degree of $k-2$. Since $P(x)$ has integral coefficients, $aQ(x)$ must have integral coefficients. Since $a$ is not an integer, $Q(x)$ must have a degree of $0$, so $Q(x)$ is constant. Let $Q(x) = b$, where $b$ is an integer. We get $P(x) = x(x-a)b$. Since $P(x)$ has a leading coefficient of $1$, $b$ must be $1$. Therefore, $P(x) = x(x-a)$, and $P(x) - 1 = x(x-a) - 1 = x^2 - ax - 1$. We know that $1$ is a root of $P(x) - 1$, so $1^2 - a(1) - 1 = 0$, or $a = 0$. We know that $2$ is a root of $P(x-2)$, so $(2)^2 - 2(2) - 1 = 0$, or $-1 = 0$, which is a contradiction. 
Therefore, $P(x)$ must have a degree of at least $2$. Let $P(x) = x^2(x-a)R(x)$, where $R(x)$ has a degree of $k-3$. Since $P(x)$ has integral coefficients, $aR(x)$ must have integral coefficients. $a$ is not an integer, so $R(x)$ must have a degree of $1$. Let $R(x) = bx + c$, where $b$ and $c$ are integers. We have $P(x) = x^2(x-a)(bx+c)$. We know that $P(3x) = 0$, so $(3x)^2(3x-a)(3bx+c) = 0$. We can factor out a $3^3$ to get $3^3(x^2(x-a)(bx+c)) = 0$. We know that $3^3$ cannot be $0$, so $x^2(x-a)(bx+c) = 0$. We know that $P(x)$ has a leading coefficient of $1$, so $b = 1$. Therefore, $x^2(x-a)(x+c) = 0$. We know that $4P(x) = 0$, so $4x^2(x-a)(x+c) = 0$, or $4x^3 + 4ax^2 + 4cx^2 + 4acx = 0$, or $4x^3 + (4a+4c)x^2 + 4acx = 0$. We can factor out a $4x$ to get $4x(x^2 + (a+c)x + ac) = 0$. Since $P(x)$ has integral coefficients, $a+c$ must be an integer. Since $P(x)$ has integral coefficients, $ac$ must be an integer. Therefore, $x^2 + (a+c)x + ac$ must have a rational root. By the Rational Root Theorem, the only possible rational roots are $\pm 1$ and $\pm ac$. 
We know that $1$ is a root of $P(x) - 1$, so $1^2 - a(1) - 1 = 0$, or $a = 0$. We know that $2$ is a root of $P(x-2)$, so $(2-2)^2 - 0(2-2) - 1 = 0$, or $-1 = 0$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the possible rational roots are $-1, 1, -ac, ac$. 
We know that $1$ and $2$ are roots of $P(x) - 1$, so $(1-a)(2-a) = 0$. We know that $3$ is a root of $P(3x)$, so $(3-3a)(3-ac) = 0$. We know that $4$ is a root of $4P(x)$, so $(4)(4-4a)(4-4c) = 0$. We also know that $a+c$ and $ac$ are integers. 
The possible values of $a$ and $c$ are $0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, 4, -4, 6, -6, 9, -9$. These values can be derived by using the Rational Root Theorem on $(1-a)(2-a) = 0$, $(3-3a)(3-ac) = 0$, and $(4)(4-4a)(4-4c) = 0$. We know that $a$ is not an integer, so the possible values of $c$ are $1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, 4, -4, 6, -6, 9, -9$. 
We know that $P(x) - 1 = 0$ has solutions $1$ and $2$, so $(x-1)(x-2) = 0$, or $x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0$. We know that $3$ is a root of $P(3x)$, so $(3x-3)(3x-ac-3) = 0$, or $9x^2 - 9x - 3acx + 3ac - 9x + 9 + 3ac = 0$, or $9x^2 - 18x + 9 + 3ac(1 - x) = 0$, or $x^2 - 2x + 1 + \frac{ac}{3}(1-x) = 0$. We know that $4$ is a root of $4P(x)$, so $(x-4)(x-4a)(x-4c) = 0$, or $x^3 - 4ax^2 - 4cx^2 + 16acx - 4ax + 16a^2 + 16ac - 4cx + 16c^2 = 0$, or $x^3 - (4a+4c)x^2 + (16ac-4a-4c)x + 16a^2 + 16ac + 16c^2 = 0$. We know that $a+c$ and $ac$ are integers, so $(4a+4c)$ and $(16ac-4a-4c)$ must be divisible by $3$. 
We know that $P(x) - 1 = 0$ has solutions $1$ and $2$, so $1^2 - 2(1) + 1 + \frac{ac}{3}(1-1) = 0$, or $1 - 2 + 1 = 0$, or $0 = 0$. We know that $3$ is a root of $P(3x)$, so $3^2 - 2(3) + 1 + \frac{ac}{3}(1-3) = 0$, or $9 - 6 + 1 - 6ac = 0$, or $4 - 6ac = 0$, or $6ac = 4$, or $ac = \frac{2}{3}$. We know that $4$ is a root of $4P(x)$, so $4^3 - (4a+4c)(4^2) + (16ac-4a-4c)(4) + 16a^2 + 16ac + 16c^2 = 0$, or $64 - (4a+4c)(16) + (16ac-4a-4c)(4) + 16a^2 + 16ac + 16c^2 = 0$, or $64 - (4a+4c)(16) + (64ac-16a-16c) + 16a^2 + 16ac + 16c^2 = 0$, or $64 - 64a - 64c + 64ac + 64ac - 16a - 16c + 64ac + 16a^2 + 16ac + 16c^2 = 0$, or $-64a - 64c + 128ac + 16a - 16c + 64ac + 16a^2 + 16ac + 16c^2 = 0$, or $16a^2 + 64ac - 48a + 16c^2 - 80c = 0$, or $4a^2 + 16ac - 12a + 4c^2 - 20c = 0$, or $a^2 + 4ac - 3a + c^2 - 5c = 0$, or $(a^2 + 4ac + 4c^2) - 3a - 5c = 0$, or $(a+2c)^2 - 3a - 5c = 0$. 
We know that $(4a+4c)$ and $(16ac-4a-4c)$ are divisible by $3$, so $4a+4c$ and $16ac-4a-4c$ must be either $0$ or a multiple of $3$. We know that $a$ and $c$ are not both $0$, so $4a+4c$ and $16ac-4a-4c$ cannot be $0$. Therefore, $4a+4c$ and $16ac-4a-4c$ must be a multiple of $3$. 
We know that $a+c$ and $ac$ are integers, so $a+c$ and $ac$ must be a multiple of $3$. We also know that $4a+4c$ and $16ac-4a-4c$ are a multiple of $3$, so $a+c$ and $ac$ must be a multiple of $3$ that is also a multiple of $4$. The only solution is $a+c = 12$ and $ac = 36$, so $a = 6$ and $c = 6$. 
Therefore, $P(x) = x(x-6) = x^2 - 6x$. We are looking for the root that is not an integer, so we are looking for the root of $x^2 - 6x = 0$ that is not an integer. The roots are $0$ and $6$, so the root that is not an integer is $0$. Therefore, $m + n = 0 + 0 = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }49}$.

Model Final Answer #2: abstain
Model Answer #2: We can write $P(x)$ as $$(x-1)(x-1)(x-2+2)(3x-3)(4x-4)Q(x)=(x-1)^2x(x-1)(x-3)(x-1)Q(x)=(x-1)^4(x-3)Q(x).$$Note that $P(3)=0,$ so $(3-1)^4(3-3)Q(3)=0,$ which means $Q(3)=0.$ Thus, $3$ is a root of $Q(x),$ so $Q(x)$ contains a factor of $x-3.$
Note that $P(4)=0,$ so $(4-1)^4(4-3)Q(4)=0,$ which means $Q(4)=0.$ Thus, $4$ is a root of $Q(x),$ so $Q(x)$ contains a factor of $x-4.$
Finally, note that $P(2)=0,$ so $(2-1)^4(2-3)Q(2)=0,$ which means $Q(2)=0.$ Thus, $2$ is a root of $Q(x),$ so $Q(x)$ contains a factor of $x-2.$

Thus, $Q(x)$ contains at least three linear factors, so $Q(x)$ is linear: $Q(x)=cx-d$ for some constants $c$ and $d.$
Now, $P(x)=(x-1)^4(x-3)Q(x)=(x-1)^4(x-3)(cx-d).$

Finally, note that $\frac mn$ is a root of $P(x)$ if and only if $nx-m$ is a root of $P\left(\frac{x+m}n\right)=P\left(\frac{x+\frac mn+\frac mn}n\right)=P\left(\frac{x+\frac 2n}n\right)=\left(\frac{x+\frac 2n+\frac 1n-1}n\right)^4\left(\frac{x+\frac 2n+\frac 1n-1}n-3\right)\left(c\left(\frac{x+\frac 2n+\frac 1n-1}n\right)-d\right).$ Since $\frac mn$ is not an integer, $nx-m$ is not an integer, so we can replace $x$ with $nx-m:$ $P(x)=\left(\frac{x+\frac 2n+\frac 1n-1}n\right)^4\left(\frac{x+\frac 2n+\frac 1n-1}n-3\right)\left(c\left(\frac{x+\frac 2n+\frac 1n-1}n\right)-d\right).$
In this expression, we see that the $x$ "coefficient" of the term $\left(\frac{x+\frac 2n+\frac 1n-1}n-3\right)$ is $1-\frac 3n,$ so $1-\frac 3n=1,$ which means $\frac 3n=0,$ which means $\frac mn=\boxed{\frac{22}7}.$

Model Final Answer #3: E
Model Answer #3: First, we know that $P(x)=(x-1)Q(x)$ where $Q(x)$ is a polynomial with a leading coefficient $1$.
Second, we know that $Q(x-2)=(x-2-1)Q(x-2-1)=(x-3)Q(x-3)$. We repeat this process until we get $Q(x-2^n)=(x-1-n)Q(x-1-n)$.
Third, we know that $Q(3x)=3Q(x)$
Fourth, we know that $P(x)$ is a factor of $4P(x)$, so $Q(x)$ is a factor of $4Q(x)$, which means that $Q(x)$ is constant or $Q(0)=0$.
Let's consider the case when $Q(x)$ is constant. $Q(x)$ can only be $1$ or $-1$ because $Q(x)$ has a leading coefficient $1$.
If $Q(x)=1$, then $Q(x-2^n)=1$, and $x-1-n=x-2^n-1$, so $2^n=n$. This equation has no solutions since $n$ is an integer.
If $Q(x)=-1$, then $Q(x-2^n)=(-1)^{n+1}$, and $x-1-n=x-2^n-1$, so $2^n=n+1$. This equation has no solutions since $n$ is an integer.
Now, let's consider the case when $Q(0)=0$. In this case, we have $Q(x)=xR(x)$ for some polynomial $R(x)$. We can rewrite $Q(x-2^n)= (x-2^n)R(x-2^n)$ as $(x-1-n)R(x-1-n)$. Therefore, $x-2^n-1=x-1-n$, so $n=2^n$. The only solution to this equation is $2$. Thus, $Q(x)$ has a root at $2$.
Since $Q(x)$ has a root at $2$, $Q(3\cdot 2)=-3$. However, $Q(3\cdot 2)=3Q(2)$, so $Q(2)=-1$. Therefore, $Q(x)=(x-2)S(x)$ for some polynomial $S(x)$. We can rewrite $Q(x-2^n)=(x-1-n)Q(x-1-n)$ as $(x-1-n)(x-1-n-2^n)S(x-1-n)=(x-1-n-2^n)(x-2^n-1)S(x-1-n)$. Therefore, $(x-1-n-2^n)S(x-1-n)=(x-1-n-2^n)S(x-1-n-2^n)$ for all $x$. Therefore, $S(x-1-n)=S(x)$ for all $x$.
Since $x-1-n$ is a factor of $P(x)$, $P(3x-3(x-1-n))=P(3)=0$. Therefore, $Q(3)=3Q(2)=0$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $S(x)$ is a constant.
Therefore, $P(x)=(x-1)(x-2)(x-2^n)$ for some positive integer $n$.
Since $P(4)=0$, $(4-1)(4-2)(4-2^n)=0$, so $n=2$. Therefore, $P(x)=(x-1)(x-2)(x-4)$.
Since $3$ is a root of $P(3x)$, $2$ is a root of $P(3(x-2))=((2-1)(2-2)(2-4))=0$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we have a contradiction, so there are no solutions.
Therefore, our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 49}$.

Model Final Answer #4: A
Model Answer #4: Since the degree of $P(x)$ is minimal, the polynomial must be monic. We can deduce that $P(1)=1$, $P(2)=2$, $P\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)=3$, and $P(1)=\frac{1}{4}$.
We can rewrite this:
$P(x)-1=(x-1)(x-a)$
$P(x-2)-2=x(x-2-b)$
$P\left(\frac{1}{3}x\right)-3=(3x-c)\left(\frac{1}{3}x-d\right)$
$4P(x)-4=4(x-4)(x-e)$
We want to find the value of $e$.
Plugging in $4$ into the 4th equation gives us $4P(4)-4=0$. Since $P(4)$ is one of the roots of $P(x)-1$, we can write $P(4)-1=(4-1)(4-a)$. Simplifying gives us $P(4)-1=3a-12$, so $3a-12=4$. Solving gives us $a=5$.
Plugging in $1$ into the first equation gives us $P(1)-1=0$. This equation tells us that $1-a=0$ or $a=1$. We can substitute this into the equation $3a-12=4$ to get $3-12=4$, which is obviously incorrect. The root of the polynomial that is not an integer must be a fraction.
$P\left(\frac{1}{3}x\right)-3=0$ can be rewritten as $\left(\frac{1}{3}x-c\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}x-d\right)$. Plugging in $x=3$, we get $P(1)-3=0$, or $1-c=0$. Thus, $c=1$. Plugging in $x=\frac{3}{d}$, we get $P(1)-3=\left(\frac{1}{d}-1\right)\left(\frac{1}{d}-d\right)$. Simplifying gives us $\frac{1}{d}-1=\frac{1-d^2}{d}$. Cross-multiplying gives us $d-1=d^2-1$, so $d=d^2$. Obviously, $d=1$ is a solution, but it doesn't work because $\frac{1}{d}$ must equal $\frac{1}{3}$. Thus, $d\neq1$.
We know that $P(x)-1=(x-1)(x-a)$, and we want to find $a$. We can expand this to get $P(x)-1=x^2-(a+1)x+a$. Plugging in $x=1$ gives us $P(1)-1=1-(a+1)+a$, or $1-1=a-a$, so $0=0$.
The root of the polynomial that is not an integer must be rational, so $d$ must be an integer. Since $d$ is an integer, $d-1=d^2-1$, or $d=d^2$. The only integer solution is $d=0,1$, and we know that $d\neq1$, so $d=0$. We can substitute this into the equation $P\left(\frac{1}{3}x\right)-3=\left(\frac{1}{3}x-c\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}x-d\right)$ to get $P\left(\frac{1}{3}x\right)-3=\left(\frac{1}{3}x-1\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}x\right)$. Expanding the left side gives us $P\left(\frac{1}{3}x\right)-3=\frac{1}{9}x^2-\frac{1}{3}x$, so $P(x)-3=\frac{1}{9}x^2-\frac{1}{3}x$. We know that $P(x)-3=(3x-0)\left(x-\frac{1}{3}\right)$, so $P(x)=3x\left(x-\frac{1}{3}\right)+3=(3x-1)x+3$. The non-integer root is $\frac{1}{3}$, so the answer is $m+n=1+3=\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 4}$.

Model Final Answer #5: B
Model Answer #5: Suppose $P(x)$ has degree $n$. By the Factor Theorem, $P(x) - 1 = (x-1)Q(x)$ for some polynomial $Q(x)$ with degree $n-1$. Thus, $P(1) - 1 = (1-1)Q(1) = 0$, so $P(1) = 1$. This tells us that $Q(x)$ has a leading coefficient of $1$ as well.
Now, we know that $P(x) = (x-2)Q(x-2)$. Thus, $P(2) = 0$, so $(2-2)Q(2-2) = 0$, so $Q(0) = 0$. Thus, $P(0) = -2 \cdot Q(0) = 0$. It follows that $0$ is not a root of $Q(x)$, so $Q(x)$ has degree $n-2$.
We also know that $P(3x) = 0$. Thus, $(3x-1)Q(3x-1) = 0$, so $Q\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 0$. Thus, $\frac{1}{3}$ is not a root of $Q(x)$, so $Q(x)$ has degree $n-3$.
Finally, we know that $4P(x) = 0$, so $4(x-1)Q(x-1) = 0$, so $Q(1) = 0$. Thus, $1$ is not a root of $Q(x)$, so $Q(x)$ has degree $n-4$.
Therefore, $Q(x)$ is a constant polynomial, and $P(x) - 1 = (x-1)Q(x) = (x-1)k$ for some constant $k$. It follows that $P(x) = xk - (k-1)$. We know that $P(2) = 0$, so $2k - (k-1) = 0$, so $k = 1$. Thus, $P(x) = x - 1$, so the only root of $P(x)$ that is not an integer is $\frac{1}{2}$, and the answer is $1+2 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)} 43}$.

Model Final Answer #6: B
Model Answer #6: Let $P(x) = (x - 1)Q(x)$. We know that $Q(1)$ is a positive integer, and that $Q(x - 1)$ has a root at $2$. Since $Q$ has a positive leading coefficient, we can write $Q(x) = R(x - 2)$. We also know that $R$ has a root at $\frac{3}{3} = 1$, so $R(x) = (x - 1)S(x)$, where $S$ has a root at $3$. The leading coefficient of $S$ is positive, so $S(x) = T(3x)$, where $T(x)$ has a root at $1$. Since $T$ has positive leading coefficient, we can write $T(x) = U(x - 1)$, and we have
\[P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(3x - 3)(4x - 4)U(x)\]
All of the roots of $P(x)$ are integers, except for one. The root of $P(x)$ that is not an integer is the root of $U(x)$, or the reciprocal of the root of $U(x - 1)$. In other words, we need to find the reciprocal of a root of $T(x) = 0$, which is $1$. Thus, the root we're looking for is $1$, and the answer is $1 + 1 = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }43}$.

Model Answer #7: From the first two conditions, we know that $P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)Q(x) + 1$. For the third condition, plugging in $x = \frac{1}{3}$ gives $P\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{3}-1\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}-2\right)Q\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + 1 = \frac{-2}{3}\cdot\frac{-5}{3}Q\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + 1 = 0$ $\Rightarrow Q\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{9}{10}$. 
For the fourth condition, plugging in $x = 1$ gives $P(1) = (1-1)(1-2)Q(1) + 1 = 0$ $\Rightarrow Q(1) = 0$. 
Hence $Q(x) = (x-1)Q_1(x)$, and $P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-1)Q_1(x) + 1 = (x-1)^2(x-2)Q_1(x) + 1$. 
The final condition gives $P(1) = (1-1)^2(1-2)Q_1(1) + 1 = 0$ $\Rightarrow Q_1(1) = 0$. 
Hence $Q_1(x) = (x-1)Q_2(x)$, and $P(x) = (x-1)^3(x-2)Q_2(x) + 1 = (x-1)^3(x-2)(x-1)Q_2(x) + 1 = (x-1)^4(x-2)Q_2(x) + 1$. 
By the Factor theorem, $P(x)$ must have a root at $x = 1$ with multiplicity greater than or equal to $4$. However, the problem states that $P(x)$ has only one non-integer root, which must be a non-repeated root. Hence $\boxed{P(x) = (x-1)^4(x-2) + 1}$ is the unique polynomial which satisfies all the conditions.

Model Final Answer #8: B
Model Answer #8: We have that $P(x)=a(x-1)(x-2)q(x)$ for some polynomial $q$ with integer coefficients, which has the root $3/3=1$. 
Also, $P(x)=b(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)r(x)$ for some polynomial $r$ with integer coefficients, which has the root $1/3$. 
So $a(1-2)q(1)=b(1-2)(1-3)(1-4)r(1)$. Simplifying, $-a=q(1)=6br(1)$. 
Since $P(3x)=0$, $a(3x-1)(3x-2)q(3x)=0\implies3a(3x-1)(3x-2)q(3)=(3a)(3)(6br(1))q(3)$. 
Therefore, $P(x)=a(x-1)(x-2)\frac{q(x)}{q(3)}=b(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)\frac{r(x)}{r(1)}$. 
Note that $\frac{q(x)}{q(3)}$ and $\frac{r(x)}{r(1)}$ are polynomials with integer coefficients, so $a=b$. Since $P(x)$ has a leading coefficient of $1$, $a=1$. 
It follows that $\frac{q(x)}{q(3)}=\frac{r(x)}{r(1)}$. 
So let $\frac{q(x)}{q(3)}=\frac{r(x)}{r(1)}=c$ for some integer $c$. 
Let $q(x)=c(3x-1)(3x-2)s(x)$ and $r(x)=c(x-3)(x-4)t(x)$ for some polynomials $s(x)$ and $t(x)$ with integer coefficients. 
Thus, $P(x)=(x-1)(x-2)c(3x-1)(3x-2)s(x)=(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)c(x-3)(x-4)t(x)$. 
Setting $x=3$ yields $2c(8)s(3)=0\implies s(3)=0$. 
Setting $x=1$ yields $-2c(-2)t(1)=0\implies t(1)=0$. 
Therefore, $P(x)=a(x-1)(x-2)(3x-1)(3x-2)(x-3)(x-4)$ for some integer $a$. 
$P(0)=24a=0\implies a=0$. 
Hence, $P(x)=0$, so $\frac{m}{n}=0$, and $m+n=\boxed{\textbf{(043) }43}$.

Model Final Answer #9: E
Model Answer #9: Let $P(x)$ have degree $n$ and let $r$ be the root which is not an integer. Note that $r$ must be rational (and hence of the form $\frac{m}{n}$) since the coefficients of $P(x)$ are all integers. Let $P(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1x+a_0.$ Note that $P(x) - 1 = 0$ has a root of $1$, implying that $1$ is a root of $P(x)$ and $a_0 = (-1)^n.$ By Vieta's formulas, $a_{n-1} = -1 - a_{n-2} - a_{n-3} - \cdots - a_0$. We can keep applying Vieta's formulas to obtain that $a_{n-1} = (-1)^{n-1} - a_{n-2} - a_{n-3} - \cdots - a_1$ and $a_{n-2} = (-1)^{n-2} - a_{n-3} - a_{n-4} - \cdots - a_1$. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us $a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} = (-1)^{n-1} - (-1)^{n-2} \Longrightarrow a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} = -2.$
Now, we have $P(3x) = 0$ has a root of $3$, implying that $3$ is a root of $a_n(3x)^n + a_{n-1}(3x)^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1(3x) + a_0$, or $27a_n+9a_{n-1}+3a_{n-2}+\cdots+3a_1+a_0 = 0 \Longrightarrow 27a_n+9(a_{n-1}-a_{n-2})+3(a_{n-2}-a_{n-3})+\cdots+3(a_1 - a_0) + (-1)^n = 0 \Longrightarrow 27a_n+9(-2)+3(-2)+\cdots+3(-2) + (-1)^n = 0 \Longrightarrow 27a_n -18(n-1) + (-1)^n = 0 \Longrightarrow 27a_n - 18n + 18 + (-1)^n = 0.$
Finally, we have $4P(x) = 0$ has a root of $4$, implying that $4$ is a root of $4a_nx^n+4a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+4a_1x+4a_0 = 0 \Longrightarrow 4a_n(4)^n+4a_{n-1}(4)^{n-1}+\cdots+4a_1(4)+4a_0 = 0 \Longrightarrow 4a_n(4^n) + 4a_{n-1}(4^{n-1}) + \cdots + 4a_1(4) + 4a_0 = 0 \Longrightarrow 4a_n(4^n) + 4a_{n-1}(4^{n-1}) + \cdots + 4a_1(4) + (-1)^n = 0 \Longrightarrow 4a_n(4^n) + 4a_{n-1}(4^{n-1}) + \cdots + 4a_1(4) + 1 + (-1)^n - 1 = 0 \Longrightarrow 4a_n(4^n) + 4a_{n-1}(4^{n-1}) + \cdots + 4a_1(4) + (-1)^n - 1 = 0 \Longrightarrow 4a_n(4^n) + 4a_{n-1}(4^{n-1}) + \cdots +4a_1(4) + (-1)^n - 2 + 1 = 0 \Longrightarrow 4a_n(4^n) + 4a_{n-1}(4^{n-1}) + \cdots +4a_1(4) + 2(-1)^n - 2 = 0 \Longrightarrow 4a_n(4^n) + 4a_{n-1}(4^{n-1}) + \cdots +4a_1(4) + 2((-1)^n - 1) = 0 \Longrightarrow 64a_n + 16(a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}) + 4(a_{n-2} - a_{n-3}) + \cdots + 4(a_1 - a_0) + 2((-1)^n - 1) = 0 \Longrightarrow 64a_n + 16(-2) + 4(-2) + \cdots + 4(-2) + 2((-1)^n - 1) = 0 \Longrightarrow 64a_n - 32(n-1) + 2((-1)^n - 1) = 0 \Longrightarrow 64a_n - 32n + 32 + 2((-1)^n - 1) = 0 \Longrightarrow 64a_n - 32n + 2((-1)^n - 1) = 0.$
Comparing the coefficients of $a_n, a_{n-1},$ and $1$ in this equation and the previous two equations, we obtain the system of equations
\begin{align*} 27a_n - 18n + 18 + (-1)^n &= 0, \\ 64a_n - 32n + 2((-1)^n - 1) &= 0, \\ (-1)^n &= -1. \end{align*}
Substituting $(-1)^n = -1$ into the second equation yields $64a_n - 32n = 0 \Longrightarrow 2a_n - n = 0 \Longrightarrow n = 2a_n.$ Substitute $n = 2a_n$ into $27a_n - 18n + 18 + (-1)^n = 0$ to get $27a_n - 18(2a_n) + 18 + (-1)^n = 0 \Longrightarrow -9a_n + 18 + (-1)^n = 0 \Longrightarrow 9a_n - 18 = (-1)^n.$
Since $a_n$ is an integer, we know $9a_n - 18$ is divisible by $9$. However, $(-1)^n$ can only be $1$ or $-1$, which is not divisible by $9$. Thus, there is no solution to this system of equations, and $P(x)$ does not exist. The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 49}.$

Model Final Answer #10: abstain
Model Answer #10: Since $1$ is a root of $P(x)-1$, $P(1)-1=0$, meaning $P(1) = 1$. Then, let $P(x) = (x-1)Q(x) + 1$. We know that $2$ is a root of $P(x-2)$, so let $x = 4$. Then, $P(2) = 0$. Plugging this into $P(x)$, we get that $Q(2) = -1$. Similarly, we have that $3$ is a root of $P(3x)$, so $P(1) = 0$. Plugging this into $P(x)$, we get that $Q(3) = -1$. Finally, we have that $4$ is a root of $4P(x)$, so $P(4) = 0$. Plugging this into $P(x)$, we get that $Q(4) = -3$. Thus, $Q(x) = (x-2)(x-3) + 4$. We can then rewrite $P(x)$ as $(x-1)[(x-2)(x-3) + 4] + 1$.
We can then verify that $P\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = 0$, so our answer is $\boxed{5}$.

Let $C$ be the point of tangency of $C_1$ and $C_3,$ and let $D$ be the point of tangency of $C_1$ and $C_4.$ Since $C_1$ and $C_4$ are tangent at $D,$ we have $\angle O_1 DO_4 = 90^\circ,$ so triangle $DO_4 O_1$ is right-angled at $D.$ Hence, triangle $DO_4 E$ is similar to triangle $CO_3 E,$ so
\[\frac{DO_4}{CO_3} = \frac{O_4 E}{O_3 E}.\]By symmetry, $O_1 O_4 = O_2 O_4 = DO_4 = r,$ so $O_1 O_4 = r.$ The radius of $C_3$ is $\frac{1}{2} + r,$ so
\[\frac{r}{\frac{1}{2} + r} = \frac{r - \frac{1}{2}}{r - \left( \frac{1}{2} + r \right)}.\]Solving, we find $r = \boxed{\frac{1}{12}}.$

Model Final Answer #2: A
Model Answer #2: Let the centers of the circles be $O_1$ and $O_2$, and let the centers of $C_3$ and $C_4$ be $O_3$ and $O_4$, respectively. Let the point of tangency on $C_3$ with $C_1$ be $A_1$, and let the point of tangency on $C_3$ with $C_2$ be $B_1$. Similarly, let the points of tangency on $C_4$ with $C_1$ and $C_2$ be $A_2$ and $B_2$, respectively.
Since $C_3$ is internally tangent to both $C_1$ and $C_2$, triangles $O_1A_1O_3$ and $O_2B_1O_3$ are right triangles. Thus, $O_3A_1 = \sqrt{O_3O_1^2 - O_1A_1^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 1^2} = \frac{\sqrt3}{2}$.
Since $C_4$ is internally tangent to $C_1$ and externally tangent to $C_3$, triangles $O_1A_2O_4$ and $O_3A_2O_4$ are right triangles. Thus, $O_4A_2 = \sqrt{O_4O_1^2 - O_1A_2^2} = \sqrt{1^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt3}{2} + 1\right)^2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt3}{2}$. Since triangles $O_3A_1O_4$ and $O_3A_2O_4$ share an angle at $O_3$, they are similar, as are triangles $O_2B_1O_3$ and $O_2B_2O_3$. Thus, if the radius of $C_4$ is $r$, $O_4A_2 = \frac{r}{1/2} = 2r$ and $O_4B_2 = \frac{r}{1/2} = 2r$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, \[A_2B_2 = \sqrt{A_2O_4^2 + B_2O_4^2} = \sqrt{(2r)^2 + (2r)^2} = 2\sqrt{2}r.\]
Since $C_3$ is internally tangent to $C_1$ and $C_2$, $A_1B_1 = 1 - 1 = 0$, so triangles $A_1O_1B_1$ and $A_2O_4B_2$ are similar. Thus, \[\frac{2\sqrt{2}r}{1} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt3}{2} + 1 + 2r}{1/2} = \sqrt3 + 2 + 4r,\] \[2\sqrt{2}r = 2\sqrt3 + 4 + 8r,\] \[6r = 2\sqrt3 + 4,\] \[r = \boxed{\mathrm{(A)}\ \frac{1}{14}}.\]

Since $AD = AP + PD = 1 + r$, we have $CD = CP + PD = 1 - r$. However, $AB = 1$, so by the Pythagorean Theorem, $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + r^2 = \left(1 + r\right)^2$. This simplifies to $\frac{1}{4} + r^2 = 1 + 2r + r^2$. Solving this equation yields $r = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{1}{10}}$.

Model Final Answer #4: A
Model Answer #4: Let $O_1$ and $O_2$ be the centers of $C_1$ and $C_2$, respectively, and let $O_3$ and $O_4$ be the centers of $C_3$ and $C_4$, respectively. Let $r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4$ represent the radii of the corresponding circles.
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $O_1O_2$. Connect $M$ to $O_3$ and $O_4$. We can see that $\bigtriangleup MO_3O_1 \sim \bigtriangleup MO_4O_1$ by AA similarity.
The ratio of corresponding sides is $\frac{r_3}{r_1}$ and $\frac{r_4}{r_1}$. Let $r_3 = r_1k$ and $r_4 = r_1x$. We can see that $k + x = 1$ because $O_3O_4 = O_1O_2 = \frac{1}{2}$ and $O_3M = \frac{1}{2} - r_3 = \frac{1}{2} - r_1k$, $O_4M = \frac{1}{2} - r_4 = \frac{1}{2} - r_1x$.
By the Pythagorean theorem, $\left(\frac{1}{2} - r_1k\right)^2 + r_1^2 = (r_1 + r_1k)^2$
Simplifying the equation, we get $r_1^2 = \frac{1}{4}k(2 - k)$.
Similarly, $\left(\frac{1}{2} - r_1x\right)^2 + r_1^2 = (r_1 + r_1x)^2$
Simplifying the equation, we get $r_1^2 = \frac{1}{4}x(2 - x)$.
Setting the two equations equal to each other, we get $\frac{1}{4}k(2 - k) = \frac{1}{4}x(2 - x)$.
Dividing both sides by $\frac{1}{4}$ and expanding, we get $k(2 - k) = x(2 - x)$.
Since $k + x = 1$, we get $(1 - x)(2 - (1 - x)) = x(2 - x)$.
Simplifying, we get $1 - 3x + 2x^2 = 2x - x^2$.
Rearranging the equation, we get $3x^2 - x = 0$.
Factoring, we get $x(3x - 1) = 0$.
The possible values for $x$ are $0$ and $\frac{1}{3}$. Since $r_4 = r_1x$, the radius of $C_4$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }\frac{1}{14}}$.

Let $r_1, r_2, r_3,$ and $r_4$ denote the radii of circles $C_1, C_2, C_3,$ and $C_4,$ respectively. Let $x = O_4O_3,$ $y = O_4A_3,$ and $z = O_3A_3.$
Note that $\triangle O_4A_3A_4$ is an isosceles right triangle, so $z = y + r_4.$ Also, $x = y + r_3.$
By similar triangles $\triangle O_1A_1A_5 \sim \triangle O_1O_2A_2,$ so
\[\frac{r_1}{r_4} = \frac{2r_2}{r_3}.\]
By the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $\triangle O_1O_2A_2,$ we get
\[\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(r_2 + \frac{r_3}{2}\right)^2 = 1.\]
By Power of a Point on $O_3,$
\[y(2y + 2r_3 + 2r_4) = r_4^2.\]
By Power of a Point on $O_4,$
\[y(2y + 2r_3 - 2r_4) = r_4^2.\]
Subtracting these equations, we get $r_4 = r_3,$ so $x = y + r_3 = y + r_4.$
By similar triangles $\triangle O_2O_1A_5 \sim \triangle O_2A_2A_6,$
\[\frac{r_1}{r_4} = \frac{2r_2}{r_2 - r_4}.\]
Combining this equation with $\frac{r_1}{r_4} = \frac{2r_2}{r_3},$ we get $r_2 - r_4 = r_3,$ so $x = y + r_4 = y + r_2 - r_4.$
Subtracting these equations, we get $r_2 = 2r_4,$ so $r_2 = 2r_3.$
By the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $\triangle O_2O_1A_5,$
\[\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(r_2 - \frac{r_4}{2}\right)^2 = 1.\]
Substituting $r_2 = 2r_3$ and $r_4 = r_3,$ we get $\frac{3}{28},$ so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } \frac{3}{28}}.$

Let $A_1$ and $B_1$ be the points where circle $C_1$ intersects the line of centers, and let $A_2$ and $B_2$ be the respective points where circle $C_2$ intersects the line of centers. Also, let $C_3$ and $C_4$ intersect the line of centers at $C$, and $D$ respectively. Notice that $O_1O_2 = \frac{1}{2}$. $O_1O_3 = 1 + r_3$, and $O_3C = r_3$. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find that $r_3 = \sqrt{\frac{5}{4}} - \frac{1}{2}$.
Also, notice that $O_1O_4 = 1 - r_4$, and $O_4D = 1 + r_4$. Using the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $\triangle O_1DO_4$, we find that $r_4 = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{14} - \frac{1}{2}$.
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }\frac{3}{28}}$.

Model Final Answer #7: E
Model Answer #7: Join the centers of $C_3$ and $C_4$ and call their intersection $O$. Draw in radii from $C_3$ and $C_4$ to the point of tangency on $C_1$, and call these points $A$ and $B$, respectively. Also draw in radii from $C_3$ and $C_4$ to the point of tangency on $C_2$, and call these points $C$ and $D$, respectively.
By connecting $O$, $A$, and $B$ we form a right triangle. $\bigtriangleup OAB$ is a right triangle because the radius that is perpendicular to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line. Now, by connecting $O$, $C$, and $D$, we also form a right triangle. $\bigtriangleup OCD$ is a right triangle for the same reason as stated above.
$\bigtriangleup OAB$ and $\bigtriangleup OCD$ are similar right triangles because of the $AA$ postulate. Thus, we can write the following ratio: $\frac{OC}{OA}=\frac{OD}{OB}$. 
The ratio of the legs of each of the triangles is equal to the ratio of the legs of the other triangle. So, $\frac{OC}{OA}=\frac{OD}{OB}=\frac{CD}{AB}$.
Notice that $AB+CD=\frac{1}{2}$. We can call $AB$ $x$ and $CD$ $\frac{1}{2}-x$. We can write the following equation: $\frac{OC}{OA}=\frac{OD}{OB}=\frac{\frac{1}{2}-x}{x}$. We also know that $OC+OD=1$. By substituting we have: $\frac{\frac{1}{2}-x}{x}+x=1$. By multiplying both sides by $2x$, we get $1-2x^2+2x=2x\Rightarrow2x^2-2x+1=0$. By multiplying both sides by $\frac{1}{2}$ we get $x^2-x+\frac{1}{2}=0$. By multiplying both sides by $2$ we get $2x^2-2x+1=0$. By applying the quadratic formula we get $x=\frac{1\pm\sqrt{1-4(2)(1)}}{4}=\frac{1\pm\sqrt{-7}}{4}$. Because of the imaginary number in the square root, we can reject this answer. So, when $x=\frac{1-\sqrt{-7}}{4}$, $x$ is the radius of $C_3$. $C_3$ is tangent to $C_4$, so the radius of $C_4$ is $\frac{1-\sqrt{-7}}{4}-1=\frac{1-\sqrt{-7}-4}{4}=\frac{-3-\sqrt{-7}}{4}=\frac{3+\sqrt{7}i}{4}=\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\frac{1}{9}}$.

Let $O_1$ and $O_2$ be the centers of circles $C_1$ and $C_2$, respectively, and let $O_3$ be the center of circle $C_3$, and let $O_4$ be the center of circle $C_4$. Draw lines $O_3O_4$, $O_3B_3$, $O_4B_4$, $O_3A_3$, and $O_4A_4$. We have $O_3O_4O_1A_4$ is a straight line because $\angle O_3O_4O_1=\angle O_3A_4O_1=90^\circ$. Hence $O_3O_4O_1A_4$ is a straight line. Note that $O_3A_3A_4O_4$ is a straight line because $\angle O_3A_3A_4=\angle O_3O_4A_4=90^\circ$. Hence $\angle A_4A_3O_3=\angle O_4O_3A_3$. Similarly, $\angle O_4O_3B_3=\angle B_4B_3O_3$. Since $A_3A_4=B_3B_4$, we have $\triangle A_4A_3O_3\cong\triangle B_4B_3O_3$, so $O_3A_3=O_3B_3$. Thus $O_3A_3B_3O_4$ is a kite, so $O_4O_3$ bisects $\angle A_4O_3B_3$.

Since $O_3A_3B_3O_4$ is a kite, it is cyclic. Let its circumcircle be $\omega$. Since $O_3A_3=O_3B_3$, $AO_3$ and $BO_3$ are congruent tangents to $\omega$, so $AO_3$ is congruent to $BO_3$. Since $\triangle AO_3O_1\cong \triangle BO_3O_1$, we have $AO_3=BO_3$. Since $AO_3=BO_3$ and $O_3O_1$ bisects $\angle A_4O_3B_3$, we have $AO_3=BO_3=O_3O_1$. Since $O_4O_3$ bisects $\angle A_4O_3B_3$, we have $AO_3=O_3O_4$. Since $AO_3=O_3O_4$ and $O_4O_1$ bisects $\angle A_4O_3B_3$, we have $AO_3=O_4O_1$. Since $AO_3=O_4O_1$ and $O_3O_1\perp AB$, we have $\triangle AO_3O_1\cong \triangle O_4O_1O_3$. Since $\triangle AO_3O_1\cong \triangle O_4O_1O_3$, we have $A_4O_3=O_4O_3$. Thus $A_4O_3B_3O_4$ is an isosceles trapezoid. Since $A_4O_3B_3O_4$ is an isosceles trapezoid, $A_4B_3$ is congruent to $O_4O_3$. But $A_4B_3$ is also congruent to $O_4A_4$ and $O_4B_3$ (since $O_3A_3B_3O_4$ is a kite). Thus $A_4B_3=O_4A_4=O_4B_3$. Since $A_4B_3=O_4A_4=O_4B_3$, $\triangle A_4B_3O_4$ is an equilateral triangle. Thus $O_4A_4=O_4B_3=\frac{1}{2}$. Since $O_4A_4=\frac{1}{2}$, we have $O_4O_1=O_4A_4-A_4O_1=\frac{1}{2}-1=-\frac{1}{2}$. Since $O_4O_1=-\frac{1}{2}$ and $O_1O_2=\frac{1}{2}$, we have $O_4O_2=O_4O_1+O_1O_2=-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}=0$. Thus $\triangle O_4O_2O_1$ is a degenerate triangle, so $O_4$, $O_2$, and $O_1$ are collinear. Since $O_4$, $O_2$, and $O_1$ are collinear, $O_4$ lies on the radical axis of $\odot O_1$ and $\odot O_2$. Thus $O_4A^2=O_4B^2$, so $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2+x^2$. Solving, we find $x=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }\frac{3}{28}}$.

Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ intersect at $D$.
Let the radius of $C_4$ be $r$.
Let $C_3$ have center $E$ and $C_4$ have center $F$.
Let $G$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $F$ to $C_2$.
Let $H$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $E$ to $C_2$.
Let $I$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $E$ to $C_4$.
Connect $C$ to $D$, $F$ to $E$, $G$ to $E$, and $H$ to $E$.
Since $C_3$ is the largest circle internally tangent to both $C_1$ and $C_2$, it is clear that $C_3$ and $C_4$ share a common internal tangent. Also, $C_3$ and $C_4$ share a common external tangent.
By drawing $CE$, we get an isosceles triangle with base $DE$ and height $r$. The length of $CE$ is equal to $r + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = r$. Because $C_3$ and $C_4$ share a common internal tangent, $EG = r$. Thus, the length of $GH$ is $1 - r$.
By drawing $DE$, we also get a right triangle with hypotenuse $C_2D$ and base $DE$. The length of $DE$ is equal to $1 - r$.
By drawing $DF$, we get an isosceles triangle with base $C_2G$ and height $r$. The length of $DF$ is equal to $r - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = r$. Because $C_3$ and $C_4$ share a common external tangent, $EF = r$.
By drawing $DE$, we also get a right triangle with hypotenuse $C_2D$ and base $DF$. The length of $DF$ is equal to $1 - r$.
Because $\triangle C_2DE \sim \triangle C_2DF$, $\frac{1 - r}{r} = \frac{r}{1 - r} \implies r^2 = 1 - r^2 \implies r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies r = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{1}{10}}$.

Model Final Answer #10: A
Model Answer #10: Denote by $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ the four centers of the four circles $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$, and $C_4$, respectively. Let $C_3$ be the incircle of $\triangle ACD$ and $C_4$ be the $A$-excircle of $\triangle ACD$. Denote by $r_1$, $r_2$, $r_3$, and $r_4$ the radii of $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$, and $C_4$, respectively, and let $AC = x$. Now we can apply the formula for the inradius and the $A$-exradius of a triangle:
\begin{align*} r_3 &= \frac{\triangle ABC}{s} = \frac{\frac{x}{2} \cdot 1}{\frac{3}{2}x} = \frac{1}{3}, \\ r_4 &= \frac{\triangle ABC}{s-a} = \frac{\frac{x}{2} \cdot 1}{\frac{3}{2}x - 1} = \frac{1}{3x - 2}. \end{align*}
Now recall that the radius of the incircle is the harmonic mean of the radii of the excircles. Thus,
\begin{align*} \frac{2}{\frac{1}{3}} &= \frac{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3x - 2}}{2} \\ \frac{6}{1} &= \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3x - 2} \\ \frac{17}{3} &= \frac{1}{3x - 2} \\ 3x - 2 &= \frac{3}{17} \\ x &= \frac{1}{17}. \end{align*}
Finally, $r_4 = \boxed{\textbf{(A) } \frac{1}{14}}$.

23) If the positive integer $c$ has positive integer divisors $a$ and $b$ with $c = ab$, then $a$ and $b$ are said to be $\textit{complementary}$ divisors of $c$. Suppose that $N$ is a positive integer that has one complementary pair of divisors that differ by $20$ and another pair of complementary divisors that differ by $23$. What is the sum of the digits of $N$? $A)  9  B)  13 C)  15  D)  17  E)  19$
Solution: C
Model Final Answer #1: B
Model Answer #1: Like in solution 1, we let $p > q,$ and $q \leq 20$ (since the first pair of complementary divisors differ by $20$) be the divisors of $N.$ We have two equations:
\[pq = N\] \[p(p - q) = 20\]
Let's consider the second equation. The prime factorization of $20$ is $2^2 \cdot 5.$ We consider three cases.
Case 1: $p$ is even and $q$ is odd. We test values of $p$ and $p - q.$ We see that $p = 6$ and $p - q = 20$ doesn't work since $q$ is not positive. We then test $p = 10$ and $p - q = 10$ and $p = 12$ and $p - q = 5.$ The second pair works. $q = 2$ since $q \leq 20,$ so $p = 12,$ and $pq = 24.$ The first pair doesn't work. Thus, we have $(p, q) = (12, 2)$ and $(p, q) = (10, 2).$
Case 2: $p$ is odd and $q$ is even. We test values again. Testing $p = 3$ gives $p - q = 20$ and $p = 5$ gives $p - q = 5.$ The second pair doesn't work. Thus, we have $(p, q) = (3, 2).$
Case 3: $p$ and $q$ are odd. We test values again. Testing $p = 3$ gives $p - q = 20$ and $p = 5$ gives $p - q = 5.$ The second pair doesn't work. Thus, we have $(p, q) = (3, 2).$
We have $pq = 6 \cdot 2 = 12$ and $pq = 3 \cdot 2 = 6.$ The sum of the digits of $N = pq = 12$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 13}.$

Model Final Answer #2: A
Model Answer #2: Since the difference between the divisors in each pair is a prime number, then the pairs are $\{p,p+20\}$ and $\{q,q+23\}$ for primes $p$ and $q$. Also, $N=p(p+20)=q(q+23)$. We rewrite this equation as $p^2+20p=q^2+23q$. Rearranging, we have $p^2-q^2+20p-23q=0$. Factoring the quadratic, we have $(p+q+3)(p-q+20)=0$. Since $p$ and $q$ are primes, $p\pm q+3=0$ or $p\pm q+20=0$. Since $p$ and $q$ are positive, $q=p+3$ or $q=p-20$. We now have two cases:
Case 1: $q=p+3$. Substituting this into the equation $N=p(p+20)$, we have $N=(p)(p+20)=(p)(p+(p+3))=p(2p+3)$. The prime factorization of $N$ is $p\cdot 2\cdot (p+\frac{3}{2})$. Since $p$ and $2$ are prime, $p+\frac{3}{2}=1.5$. Since $p$ is an integer, $p=1$. Thus, the prime factorization of $N$ is $1\cdot 2\cdot (1.5)=3$. Thus, the sum of the digits of $N$ is $3$, which is answer choice $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }  9}$.
Case 2: $q=p-20$. Substituting this into the equation $N=p(p+20)$, we have $N=(p)(p+20)=(p)(p+(p-20))=p(2p-20)$. The prime factorization of $N$ is $p\cdot 2\cdot (p-\frac{20}{2})$. Since $p$ and $2$ are prime, $p-\frac{20}{2}=10$. Since $p$ is an integer, $p=10$. Thus, the prime factorization of $N$ is $10\cdot 2\cdot (10-10)=0$, so the sum of the digits of $N$ is $0$. However, $0$ is not an answer choice, so we discard this case.
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }  9}$.

Model Final Answer #3: B
Model Answer #3: The problem tells us that $N$ has two pairs of complementary divisors. Suppose that these pairs are $\{a_1, b_1\}$ and $\{a_2, b_2\}$, where $a_1$, $b_1$, $a_2$, and $b_2$ are positive integers and $a_1$ and $a_2$ are smaller than $b_1$ and $b_2$. Then $a_1b_1=a_2b_2=N$. We can rewrite this as $\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\frac{b_2}{b_1}$. Since both sides of the equation are in simplest form, we know that $a_1 \neq a_2$ and $b_1 \neq b_2$. Because the positive difference between the two pairs of complementary divisors is 20 and 23, we find that $|a_1-a_2|=20$ and $|b_1-b_2|=23$. Without loss of generality, let $a_1 > a_2$. Then $a_1-a_2=20$ and $b_2-b_1=23$. We can rewrite this as $a_1=a_2+20$ and $b_2=b_1+23$.
Since $ab=N$, we know that $a_1b_1=a_2b_2$. We can substitute the values of $a_1$ and $b_2$ in terms of $a_2$ and $b_1$ to get $(a_2+20)b_1=a_2(b_1+23)$. Expanding the right side of the equation and combining like terms, we have $a_2b_1+20b_1=a_2b_1+23a_2$. We can subtract $a_2b_1$ from both sides of the equation and rewrite it as $20b_1=23a_2$. Because $a_2$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $a_2$ is $20$. This means that $b_1=23$. Substituting $a_2=20$ and $b_1=23$ into $ab=N$, we find that $a_1=\frac{N}{a_2}=N/20$ and $b_2=\frac{N}{b_1}=N/23$. Because $a_1$ and $a_2$ are positive integers, $N$ must be a multiple of $20$. Because $b_1$ and $b_2$ are positive integers, $N$ must be a multiple of $23$. The smallest multiple of $20$ that is also a multiple of $23$ is $460$. Therefore, the answer is $4+6+0=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }13}$.

Model Final Answer #4: B
Model Answer #4: Suppose that the smaller of the two divisors in the first pair is $a$. Then, we have $a(a + 20) = N$. If we let $a = 10$, then $N = 300 = 3^2 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 5^2$. We can ignore this solution because we are looking for a solution with only one pair of complementary divisors that differ by $20$. 
If we let $a = 20$, then $N = 420 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$. It is clear that this is a solution with only one pair of complementary divisors that differ by $20$. 
In the same way, we can let $b$ be the smaller of the two divisors in the second pair. Then, we have $b(b + 23) = N$. If we let $b = 23$, then $N = 552 = 2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 23$. We can ignore this solution because we are looking for a solution with only one pair of complementary divisors that differ by $23$. 
If we let $b = 46$, then $N = 1938 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 31$. It is clear that this is a solution with only one pair of complementary divisors that differ by $23$. 
Therefore, the sum of the digits of $N$ is $4 + 2 + 0 = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }13}$.

Model Final Answer #5: A
Model Answer #5: If $N = ab$ and $(a, b)$ is a complementary pair of divisors, then $(a, N)$ and $(b, N)$ are also complementary pairs of divisors. We are told that $a - b = 20$ and $a - b = 23$. It follows that $a - b = 0$, which leads us to the conclusion that $a = b$. Therefore, for some positive integer $x$, we have $N = x^2$. The sum of the digits of $N$ is equal to the sum of the digits of $x^2$. The sum of the digits of $1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \ldots$ is $1, 4, 9, 1, 4, 9, \ldots$. The sum of the digits of $N$ is $9 + 1 = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }9}$.

Model Final Answer #6: B
Model Answer #6: Let the complementary pairs of divisors $(a,b)$ be of the form $(a,a+20)$ and $(b,b+23)$.
Then $ab = N = a(a+20) = b(b+23)$.
Expanding, we have $a^2+20a = b^2+23b$.
Rearranging, we get $b^2 - a^2 + 23b - 20a = (b-a)(b+a) + 23(b-a) = 0$.
This factors as $(b-a)(b+a+23) = 0$.
Since $a,b>0$, we must have $b-a \neq 0$.
Thus $b+a+23 = 0$, so $a = -b-23$.
Substituting, we have $N = ab = (-b-23)(b) = -b^2 - 23b = 20b$.
Thus $b|20b$, so $b|20$.
Since $b > 0$, $b$ must be one of $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20$.
If $b = 1$, then $a = -24$, from which $N = ab = -24 \neq 20b$.
If $b = 2$, then $a = -25$, from which $N = ab = -50 \neq 40$.
If $b = 4$, then $a = -27$, from which $N = ab = -108 \neq 80$.
If $b = 5$, then $a = -28$, from which $N = ab = -140 \neq 100$.
If $b = 10$, then $a = -33$, from which $N = ab = -330 \neq 200$.
If $b = 20$, then $a = -43$, from which $N = ab = -860 = 860$.
Thus the answer is $8 + 6 + 0 = \boxed{14 \ \mathbf{(B)}}$.

Model Answer #7: If $a$ and $b$ are complementary divisors of $c$, then $a$ and $c$ are complementary divisors of $b$, and $b$ and $c$ are complementary divisors of $a$. Since $N$ has complementary divisors that differ by $20$ and complementary divisors that differ by $23$, it has pairs of complementary divisors that differ by both $20$ and $23$.
For $N$ to have complementary divisors that differ by $20$, $N$ must be divisible by $23$ and have a complementary divisor that is $20$ greater. For $N$ to have complementary divisors that differ by $23$, $N$ must be divisible by $20$ and have a complementary divisor that is $23$ greater. We then find that $N$ must be divisible by $20 \cdot 23 = 460$.
To determine the remaining digit sum, we consider that $N = 460 \cdot k$, where $k$ is the remaining product.
To be divisible by $23$, we subtract $20$ to form $k - 20$, which is divisible by $23$. We also know that $N = 460 \cdot k$. Thus, $k = 23 \cdot m + 20$, where $m$ is the remaining product.
To be divisible by $20$, we add $23$ to form $23m + 20 + 23 = 23m + 43$, which is divisible by $20$. We also know that $k = 23 \cdot m + 20$. Thus, $m = 20 \cdot n - 43$.
The remaining product is $20 \cdot n - 43$, where $n$ is a positive integer.
The digit sum is $2 + 0 + 4 + 3 = \boxed{\textbf{(B) } 13}$.

Model Final Answer #8: C
Model Answer #8: Let $a_1$ and $b_1$ be the two divisors that differ by $20$ and $a_2$ and $b_2$ be the two divisors that differ by $23$. We have $a_2 - b_2 = 23$ and $a_1 - b_1 = 20$. Subtracting these two equations, we get $a_2-b_2-a_1+b_1 = 3$, so $a_2 - a_1 = 3$. 
Again, subtracting the two equations, we get $b_2-b_1 = -17$, so $b_2 - b_1 = -17$. 
Adding this equation to $a_2-a_1 = 3$, we get $a_2 - a_1 + b_2 - b_1 = -14$, so $(a_2-b_1)-(a_1-b_2) = -14$, so $(a_2-b_1)-(a_1-b_1) = -14$. This can be rewritten as $(a_2-b_1) + b_1 = (a_1 - b_1) + b_2$. Let $a_2 - b_1 = 0$ (this is a valid assumption because it is given that $a_2-b_1$ is a divisor of $N$), so $a_1-b_1 = 20$, $a_1 = b_1 + 20$, and $b_2 = a_1 + b_1 = 2b_1 + 20$. Since $a_2 - b_1 = 0$, $a_2 = b_1$.
Thus, $N = a_1 \cdot a_2 = (b_1+20)b_1 = b_1^2 + 20b_1$. We know that $b_1^2 + 20b_1 - N = 0$, so $b_1 = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{400 + 4N}}{2} = -10 \pm \sqrt{100 + N}$, so $100 + N$ is a perfect square. We can conclude that $N$ is between $80^2$ and $90^2$, so it is in the $6400$s. The only perfect square in the $6400$s is $6489$, so $N = 6489 - 100 = 6389$, and the sum of its digits is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 15}$.

Model Final Answer #9: C
Model Answer #9: Let $p$ and $q$ be the two pairs of complementary divisors of $N$ such that $p < q$. It can be seen that $p$ and $q$ are roots of the quadratic $x^2 - Nx + N = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, $p+q = N$. Additionally, $q-p = 20$ and $p-q = 23$. The only possible value for $N$ is $\frac{43}{2} = 21.5$. Therefore, the answer is $2+1+5 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 15}$.

Model Final Answer #10: E
Model Answer #10: Let the complementary divisors of $N$ be $a$ and $b$, where $a>b$.
Thus $a-b=20$.
By difference of squares, $(a+b)(a-b)=23(a-b)$, and so $a+b=23$.
Adding these two equations, $2a=43$, so $a=21.5$. This is impossible because $a$ must be an integer. 
Therefore no such $N$ exists, and the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }19}$.

Denote $A_1B_1C_1D_1E_1F_1$ as the regular hexagon with $A_1=A,$ $B_1=B,$ $\cdots,$ $F_1=F$ such that $A_1B_1C_1D_1E_1F_1$ contains all the blocks. Let $H_1,H_2,H_3,H_4,H_5,H_6$ be the feet of the perpendiculars from $A_1,B_1,C_1,D_1,E_1,F_1$ to $\overline{BC},\overline{CD},\overline{DE},\overline{EF},\overline{FG},\overline{GA},$ respectively. Since $\overline{H_1H_2},\overline{H_3H_4},$ and $\overline{H_5H_6}$ are concurrent at the center of the regular hexagon, it follows that $\triangle H_1H_2H_3$ is an equilateral triangle with side length $3$ units. By symmetry, $H_1H_2H_3H_4H_5H_6$ is a regular hexagon.
Without loss of generality, assume that $\overline{FG}$ is horizontal. By symmetry, we can deduce that $\overline{GH_5}=\frac37$ units and $\angle FGH_5=120^\circ.$ As $\triangle FGH_5$ is a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle, we obtain $\overline{GF}=\frac{3}{7\sqrt{3}}$ units. By symmetry, it follows that $\overline{GF_1}=\frac{3}{7\sqrt{3}}$ units and $\overline{A_1F_1}=\frac{6}{7\sqrt{3}}$ units. Therefore, the area of the region inside $\triangle ABC$ and outside $A_1B_1C_1D_1E_1F_1$ is \[\triangle ABC-\triangle A_1B_1C_1-\triangle C_1D_1E_1-\triangle E_1F_1A_1=\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\cdot1^2\right)-\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\cdot\left(\frac{6}{7\sqrt{3}}\right)^2\right)=\boxed{\textbf{(A) } \frac{13 \sqrt{3}}{3}}.\]

Model Final Answer #2: B
Model Answer #2: Let $x$ be the side length of the regular hexagon. Consider the top-right vertex of the hexagon. The distance from this vertex to the nearest vertex of a hexagonal block is $\frac{3}{7}$. This means that the sum of the height of the hexagonal block and the height of the equilateral triangle that is on top of the block is $\frac{3}{7}$. Since the height of an equilateral triangle is $\sqrt{3}$ times the side length, the height of the hexagonal block is $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{7}$. The area of a hexagonal block is $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{7})=\frac{27}{14}$, and the area of the entire hexagonal blocks is $6\cdot \frac{27}{14}=\frac{81}{7}$. The area of the entire hexagon is $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}x^2$, so the area of the region inside the frame not occupied by the blocks is $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}x^2-\frac{81}{7}$. Since the side length of the hexagon is $1$, the area of the region inside the frame not occupied by the blocks is $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}-\frac{81}{7}=\boxed{\textbf{(B)} ~\frac{216 \sqrt{3}}{49}}$.

Model Final Answer #3: B
Model Answer #3: We can place one of the hexagonal blocks at the center of the hexagonal frame. Then, we can draw a line segment from the center of the frame to the center of one of the edges on the frame. Since the distance from a corner of the frame to the nearest vertex of a block is $\frac{3}{7}$ unit, the distance from the center of the frame to a vertex of a block is $\frac{3}{7}+\frac{1}{2}=\frac{17}{14}$ unit. Drawing the radius of the hexagonal block, we can find that the side length of the frame is $\frac{3}{7}+\frac{3}{14}=\frac{9}{14}$ unit. The area of the frame is then $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \left(\frac{9}{14}\right)^2=\frac{27\sqrt{3}}{56}$.
The area of one of the hexagonal blocks is $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}$. There are $6$ blocks, so the total area of the blocks is $6\cdot\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}=\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
Therefore, the area of the region inside the frame not occupied by the blocks is $\frac{27\sqrt{3}}{56}-\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{2}=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{216 \sqrt{3}}{49}}$.

Model Final Answer #4: D
Model Answer #4: We begin by considering the triangle formed by a corner of the frame and two adjacent vertices of a block. Let the side length of the hexagonal frame be $x$. Let the corner of the frame be $A$, and let the adjacent vertices of the block be $B$ and $C$, with $BC$ parallel to a side of the frame. Let $O$ be the midpoint of $BC$, so $AO=\frac{x}{2}$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $AB = AC = \sqrt{(AO)^2 - (OC)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x$.

Now consider the triangle formed by the midpoint $O$ of the side of the hexagonal frame, and two adjacent vertices of a block. Let the adjacent vertices of the block be $B$ and $C$, with $BC$ parallel to a side of the frame. Let $A$ be the midpoint of $BC$, so $AO = \frac{x}{2}$. Let $\theta = \angle BAO$. Using the Law of Cosines on $\triangle AOB$, we have:
\begin{align*} AB^2 &= AO^2 + BO^2 - 2(AO)(BO)\cos(\theta) \\ \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x\right)^2 &= \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 + 1 - 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)(1)\cos(\theta) \\ \frac{3}{4}x^2 &= \frac{1}{4}x^2 + 1 - x\cos(\theta) \\ \frac{1}{2}x^2 &= 1 - x\cos(\theta) \hspace{15mm}(1) \end{align*}

Using the Law of Cosines on $\triangle AOC$, we have:
\begin{align*} AC^2 &= AO^2 + OC^2 - 2(AO)(OC)\cos(60^\circ - \theta) \\ \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x\right)^2 &= \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)\cos(60^\circ - \theta) \\ \frac{3}{4}x^2 &= \frac{1}{4}x^2 + \frac{9}{49} - \frac{3}{7}x\cos(60^\circ - \theta) \\ \frac{1}{2}x^2 &= \frac{9}{49} - \frac{3}{7}x\cos(60^\circ - \theta) \hspace{11mm} (2) \end{align*}
Substituting $(1)$ into $(2)$, we have:
\begin{align*} \frac{9}{49} - \frac{3}{7}x\cos(60^\circ - \theta) &= 1 - x\cos(\theta) \\ \frac{8}{49} &= \frac{24}{7}x\cos(60^\circ - \theta) \\ \frac{1}{7} &= 3x\cos(60^\circ - \theta) \\ \frac{1}{7} &= 3x\left(\cos(60^\circ)\cos(\theta) + \sin(60^\circ)\sin(\theta)\right) \\ \frac{1}{7} &= 3x\left(\frac{1}{2}\cos(\theta) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\sin(\theta)\right) \\ \frac{1}{7} &= \frac{3x}{2}\cos(\theta) + \frac{3\sqrt{3}x}{2}\sin(\theta) \\ \frac{2}{3x} &= \cos(\theta) + \frac{\sqrt{3}x}{2}\sin(\theta) \\ \frac{2}{3x} - \cos(\theta) &= \frac{\sqrt{3}x}{2}\sin(\theta) \\ \frac{4}{3x} - 2\cos(\theta) &= \sqrt{3}x\sin(\theta) \\ \left(\frac{4}{3x} - 2\cos(\theta)\right)^2 &= \left(\sqrt{3}x\sin(\theta)\right)^2 \\ \left(\frac{4}{3x} - 2\cos(\theta)\right)^2 &= 3x^2\sin^2(\theta) \\ \left(\frac{4}{3x}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{4}{3x}\right)\left(2\cos(\theta)\right) + (2\cos(\theta))^2 &= 3x^2\sin^2(\theta) \\ \frac{16}{9x^2} - \frac{16}{3x}\cos(\theta) + 4\cos^2(\theta) &= 3x^2\sin^2(\theta) \\ \frac{16}{9x^2} - \frac{16}{3x}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 4\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 &= 3x^2\left(1-\cos^2(\theta)\right) \\ \frac{16}{9x^2} - \frac{8}{3} + 2\left(\frac{x^2}{4}\right) &= 3x^2\left(1-\cos^2(\theta)\right) \\ \frac{16}{9x^2} - \frac{8}{3} + \frac{x^2}{2} &= 3x^2\sin^2(\theta) \\ \frac{16}{9x^2} - \frac{8}{3} + \frac{x^2}{2} &= 3x^2\left(1-\frac{1}{4}\right) \\ \frac{16}{9x^2} - \frac{8}{3} + \frac{x^2}{2} &= \frac{9}{4}x^2 \\ \frac{16}{9x^2} - \frac{8}{3} + \frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{9}{4}x^2 &= 0 \\ \frac{16}{9x^2} - \frac{24}{6x} + \frac{4x^2}{4} - \frac{36x^2}{4} &= 0 \\ \frac{16}{9x^2} - \frac{24}{6x} + \frac{4x^2}{4} - \frac{36x^2}{4} &= 0 \\ \frac{16}{9x^2} - \frac{36}{6x} + \frac{4x^2}{4} &= 0 \\ \frac{16}{9x^2} - \frac{36}{6x} + x^2 &= 0 \\ \frac{16}{9x^2} - \frac{18}{3x} + x^2 &= 0 \end{align*}
We can factor this as:
\begin{align*} 0 &= \frac{16}{9x^2} - \frac{18}{3x} + x^2 \\ 0 &= \frac{16}{9x^2} - \frac{12}{3x} - \frac{6}{3x} + x^2 \\ 0 &= \frac{16}{9x^2} - \frac{12}{3x} - \frac{6}{3x} + x^2 \\ 0 &= \left(\frac{4}{3x}-2\right)\left(\frac{4}{3x}-3x\right) \\ \end{align*}
So either $\frac{4}{3x} = 3x$ or $\frac{4}{3x} = 2$. Clearly $\frac{4}{3x} \ne 2$, so we must have $\frac{4}{3x} = 3x$, which gives us $x^2 = \frac{4}{9}$, so $x = \frac{2}{3}$.

So the side length of the hexagonal frame is $\frac{2}{3}$, and its area is $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}$.
The area of each of the six blocks is $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$, so the total area of the six blocks is $\frac{6\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Therefore, the area of the region inside the frame but not occupied by the blocks is $\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }\frac{14 \sqrt{3}}{3}}$.

Let $O$ be the center of the hexagon and $P$ be one of the vertices of the hexagon. Note that $\angle OPA = 60^{\circ}$. Let $OP = d$. By the Law of Cosines in $\triangle OPA$, we have $d^2 = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 + 1 - 2\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)(1)\cos 60^{\circ} = \frac{7}{3}$. Therefore, $d = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{3}$, and the area of $\triangle OPA$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{9}$. The area of the hexagons is $6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{9} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{3}$, and the area of the region inside the frame but outside the hexagons is $\frac{45x^2\sqrt{3}}{16} - \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{3} = \frac{3x^2\sqrt{3}}{16}$. Substituting $x = 2y$, we get $A = \frac{3(2y)^2\sqrt{3}}{16} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) } \frac{13 \sqrt{3}}{3}}$.

Model Final Answer #6: B
Model Answer #6: Let the side length of the exterior hexagon be $x$. The distance from a corner of the hexagon to the nearest vertex of the block is $\frac37$. Hence, the distance from the same corner to the farthest vertex of the block is $\frac37+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}=\frac{3+7\sqrt{3}}{7\sqrt{3}}$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $(2x)^2=\left(\frac{3+7\sqrt{3}}{7\sqrt{3}}\right)^2+x^2$, and solving for $x$ gives $x=\frac{7\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Thus, the area of the region inside the frame but outside the blocks is the area of the exterior hexagon minus the sum of the areas of the blocks, which is $6\cdot\frac{7\sqrt{3}}{2}^2-6\cdot\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}=6\cdot\frac{147}{4}-6\cdot\frac{3}{4}=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } \frac{216\sqrt{3}}{49}}$.

Model Final Answer #7: B
Model Answer #7: Let's place the hexagon in the coordinate plane. Let the coordinates of the vertices of the hexagon be $(0,0),(3,0),(6,0),(0,3\sqrt3),(3,3\sqrt3),(6,3\sqrt3)$.
Now, let $P$ denote the intersection of the bottom edge of the hexagon and the left edge of the hexagon. 
We can find that the coordinates of $P$ are $(1,\frac{\sqrt3}{7})$. 
Similarly, let $Q$ denote the intersection of the right edge of the hexagon and the bottom edge of the hexagon. 
We can find that the coordinates of $Q$ are $(5,\frac{\sqrt3}{7})$. 
Now, note that the area of the hexagon is $9\sqrt3$. 
By symmetry, we can see that the desired area is equal to the area of the hexagon minus the area of the isosceles triangle formed by the two lines $y=\frac{\sqrt3}{7}$ and $y=\frac{6\sqrt3}{7}$ and the line connecting the midpoints of $P$ and $Q$. 
We can find that the midpoints of $P$ and $Q$ are $(3,\frac{\sqrt3}{7})$ and $(3,\frac{3\sqrt3}{7})$, respectively. 
Thus, the equation of the line connecting the midpoints of $P$ and $Q$ is $x=3$. 
We can now find the area of the triangle to be $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot \frac{3\sqrt3}{7}=\frac{9\sqrt3}{7}$.
Thus, the area of the region is $9\sqrt3 - \frac{9\sqrt3}{7} = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{216 \sqrt{3}}{49}}$.

Model Final Answer #8: abstain
Model Answer #8: Let $x$ be the distance from the center of a block (one of the green dots) to the midpoint of a side of a block (one of the purple dots). Let $y$ be the distance from the center of a block to a purple dot. If we draw the radius of a block (red in the diagram below), we find that $\frac{1}{2}x + y = \frac{3}{7}$. Also, note that a regular hexagon is made up of 6 equilateral triangles, so the side-to-height ratio of an equilateral triangle is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. This tells us that $\frac{1}{2}x + y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x$, or $y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x - \frac{1}{2}x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Solving this equation for $x$, we find that $x = \frac{\frac{3}{7}}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{3}{7}}{\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{6}{7}}{\sqrt{3} - 1}$. Now, let's look at the bottom left most corner of the frame. We draw the following diagram:
[asy] size(200); draw((0,0)--(6,0)--(9,3sqrt(3))--(6,6sqrt(3))--(0,6sqrt(3))--(-3,3sqrt(3))--cycle); fill((0,0)--(6,0)--(9,3sqrt(3))--(6,6sqrt(3))--(0,6sqrt(3))--(-3,3sqrt(3))--cycle, gray); draw((0,0)--(6,0)); draw((0,0)--(3,sqrt(3))); draw((0,0)--(-3,sqrt(3))); draw((0,0)--(-3,-sqrt(3))); draw((0,0)--(3,-sqrt(3))); draw((0,0)--(6,0)--(9,3sqrt(3))--(6,6sqrt(3))--(0,6sqrt(3))--(-3,3sqrt(3))--cycle); draw((-3,3sqrt(3))--(0,6sqrt(3))); draw((0,6sqrt(3))--(6,6sqrt(3))); draw((6,6sqrt(3))--(9,3sqrt(3))); draw((9,3sqrt(3))--(6,0)); draw((6,0)--(0,0)); label("$x$",(3,0),S); label("$\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2}$",(1.5,sqrt(3)/2),SW); label("$1$",(4.5,sqrt(3)/2),SE); label("$y$",(0.5,sqrt(3)/2),NW); [/asy]
By the Pythagorean Theorem, we find that $\left(\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 + 1^2 = y^2$. Substituting $\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2}$ for $y$, we find that $\left(\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 + 1^2 = \left(\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2$, so $1 = 0$, which is clearly false. What went wrong here? The problem is that we assumed that the bottom left most corner of the frame was equidistant from the corner of the frame to the left of it and the corner of the frame below it. In reality, the bottom left most corner of the frame is closest to the corner of the frame to the left of it. To resolve this issue, we redraw the diagram:
[asy] size(200); draw((0,0)--(6,0)--(9,3sqrt(3))--(6,6sqrt(3))--(0,6sqrt(3))--(-3,3sqrt(3))--cycle); fill((0,0)--(6,0)--(9,3sqrt(3))--(6,6sqrt(3))--(0,6sqrt(3))--(-3,3sqrt(3))--cycle, gray); draw((0,0)--(6,0)); draw((0,0)--(3,sqrt(3))); draw((0,0)--(-3,sqrt(3))); draw((0,0)--(-3,-sqrt(3))); draw((0,0)--(3,-sqrt(3))); draw((0,0)--(6,0)--(9,3sqrt(3))--(6,6sqrt(3))--(0,6sqrt(3))--(-3,3sqrt(3))--cycle); draw((-3,3sqrt(3))--(0,6sqrt(3))); draw((0,6sqrt(3))--(6,6sqrt(3))); draw((6,6sqrt(3))--(9,3sqrt(3))); draw((9,3sqrt(3))--(6,0)); draw((6,0)--(0,0)); label("$x$",(3,0),S); label("$y$",(1.5,sqrt(3)/2),SW); label("$1$",(4.5,sqrt(3)/2),SE); label("$\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2}$",(0.5,sqrt(3)/2),NW); [/asy]
By the Pythagorean Theorem, we find that $1^2 + \left(\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = y^2$. Substituting $\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2}$ for $y$, we find that $1 + \left(\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2$, so $1 = 0$, which is clearly false. What went wrong here? We can't draw a radius of a block from the corner of the frame to the corner of the frame directly below it because the corner of the frame directly below it doesn't actually exist! In other words, the distance from the bottom left most corner of the frame to the corner of the frame directly below it is $1$, not $y$. To resolve this issue, we redraw the diagram:
[asy] size(200); draw((0,0)--(6,0)--(9,3sqrt(3))--(6,6sqrt(3))--(0,6sqrt(3))--(-3,3sqrt(3))--cycle); fill((0,0)--(6,0)--(9,3sqrt(3))--(6,6sqrt(3))--(0,6sqrt(3))--(-3,3sqrt(3))--cycle, gray); draw((0,0)--(6,0)); draw((0,0)--(3,sqrt(3))); draw((0,0)--(-3,sqrt(3))); draw((0,0)--(-3,-sqrt(3))); draw((0,0)--(3,-sqrt(3))); draw((0,0)--(6,0)--(9,3sqrt(3))--(6,6sqrt(3))--(0,6sqrt(3))--(-3,3sqrt(3))--cycle); draw((-3,3sqrt(3))--(0,6sqrt(3))); draw((0,6sqrt(3))--(6,6sqrt(3))); draw((6,6sqrt(3))--(9,3sqrt(3))); draw((9,3sqrt(3))--(6,0)); draw((6,0)--(0,0)); label("$x$",(3,0),S); label("$\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2}$",(1.5,sqrt(3)/2),SW); label("$1$",(4.5,sqrt(3)/2),SE); label("$1$",(0.5,sqrt(3)/2),NW); [/asy]

Model Final Answer #9: D
Model Answer #9: Intuitively, we know that the area of the frame is $49$ times the area of each block, so we need to find the area of each block. Let us consider a single block first.

[asy]  unitsize(2cm); defaultpen(fontsize(9pt));  pair A, B, C, D, E, F, M, N, O, P, Q, R;  A = dir(30); B = dir(90); C = dir(150); D = dir(210); E = dir(270); F = dir(330); M = intersectionpoint(A--C,B--D); N = intersectionpoint(B--D,C--E); O = intersectionpoint(C--E,D--F); P = intersectionpoint(D--F,E--A); Q = intersectionpoint(E--A,F--B); R = intersectionpoint(F--B,A--C);  draw(M--N--O--P--Q--R--cycle); draw(A--C); draw(B--D); draw(C--E); draw(D--F); draw(E--A); draw(F--B);  dot("$A$",A,1.5*dir(A),linewidth(4pt)); dot("$B$",B,1.5*dir(B),linewidth(4pt)); dot("$C$",C,1.5*dir(C),linewidth(4pt)); dot("$D$",D,1.5*dir(D),linewidth(4pt)); dot("$E$",E,1.5*dir(E),linewidth(4pt)); dot("$F$",F,1.5*dir(F),linewidth(4pt)); dot("$M$",M,1.5*dir(M),linewidth(4pt)); dot("$N$",N,1.5*dir(N),linewidth(4pt)); dot("$O$",O,1.5*dir(O),linewidth(4pt)); dot("$P$",P,1.5*dir(P),linewidth(4pt)); dot("$Q$",Q,1.5*dir(Q),linewidth(4pt)); dot("$R$",R,1.5*dir(R),linewidth(4pt)); [/asy]
Let $O$ be the centre of the hexagon. It is easy to see that $O$ is also the centre of the block. Let $M$ be the point of tangency between the frame and the block. Let $N$ and $P$ be the points where the block intersects the frame. We know that $NO = NP = \frac{3}{7}$. We know that $\angle NOB = \angle NPB = 120^\circ$ since $\angle MOB = 120^\circ$. We can find $NB$ and $PB$ using the Law of Cosines: 
\[NB = NP = \frac{3}{7}, \quad PB = \sqrt{\left(\frac{3}{7}\right)^2 + 1 - 2 \cdot \frac{3}{7} \cdot 1 \cdot \cos 120^\circ} = \sqrt{\frac{13}{7}}.\]
We can now find the area of $\triangle NOB$ by using the formula $\frac{1}{2} \cdot ab \cdot \sin C$:
\[[NOB] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{7} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{13}{7}} \cdot \sin 120^\circ = \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{14}.\]
Since $\angle NOB = \angle MOB$ and $\angle NOB + \angle MOB + \angle NMO = 180^\circ$, we have $\triangle NOB \sim \triangle MOB \sim \triangle NMO$. Thus, $MO = 2 \cdot NO = \frac{6}{7}$, so \[[MOB] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdot \sin 120^\circ = \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{7}.\]
Finally, the area of each block is \[[NOBM] = [MOB] - [NOB] = \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{7} - \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{14} = \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{14}.\]
Multiplying this by $49$ gives the area of the frame, so our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)} ~ \frac{14 \sqrt{3}}{3}}$.

We can draw the diagram as shown above. Since $AB = 1$ and $\angle BAC = 120^\circ$, we have $AC = \sqrt{3}$. Since $OC = \frac{1}{2}$ and $OK = \frac{11}{28}$, we have $KC = \frac{3}{7} - \frac{11}{28} = \frac{13}{28}$. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem on $\triangle OKC$, we have
\[OK^2 = OC^2 + KC^2 \implies \left(\frac{11}{28}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{13}{28}\right)^2 \implies OK = \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{7}.\]
The area of the hexagon is $6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{2}$. The area of the shaded region is the area of the hexagon minus the area of $\triangle OKC$, which is $\frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{\frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{7} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{2} = \frac{9 \sqrt{3}}

25) If $A$ and $B$ are vertices of a polyhedron, define the distance $d(A, B)$ to be the minimum number of edges of the polyhedron one must traverse in order to connect $A$ and $B$. For example, $\overline{AB}$ is an edge of the polyhedron, then $d(A, B) = 1$, but if $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{CB}$ are edges and $\overline{AB}$ is not an edge, then $d(A, B) = 2$. Let $Q$, $R$, and $S$ be randomly chosen distinct vertices of a regular icosahedron (regular polyhedron made up of $20$ equilateral triangles). What is the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$? $A) \frac{7}{22} B) \frac{1}{3} C) \frac{3}{8} D) \frac{5}{12} E) \frac{1}{2}$
Solution: A
Model Final Answer #1: A
Model Answer #1: There are 2 cases for which $d(Q,R)$ is greater than $d(R,S)$:
1. $Q$, $R$, and $S$ are collinear, but $R$ is in between $Q$ and $S$.
2. $Q$, $R$, and $S$ are collinear, but $S$ is in between $Q$ and $R$.
For the first case, we will need to choose an edge $E_1$ that $Q$ or $R$ is on, and an edge $E_2$ that $R$ or $S$ is on. The probability of each of these is $2/20 \times 2/20 = 1/100$. The probability that the other vertex of $E_1$ is nearer to $Q$ than $R$ is $1/2$, and likewise for $E_2$. Therefore, the probability of case 1 occurring is $(1/100)^2 \times 1/2 \times 1/2 = 1/1600$. 
For the second case, we will need to choose an edge $E_1$ that $Q$ or $R$ is on, and an edge $E_2$ that $R$ or $S$ is on, similar to the first case. The probability of each of these is $2/20 \times 2/20 = 1/100$. The probability that the other vertex of $E_1$ is nearer to $Q$ than $S$ is $1/2$, and likewise for $E_2$. Therefore, the probability of case 1 occurring is $(1/100)^2 \times 1/2 \times 1/2 = 1/1600$. 
Since these 2 cases are mutually exclusive, the probability of either occurring is simply $1/1600 + 1/1600 = 1/800$. 
However, the problem asks for the probability that $d(Q,R) > d(R,S)$, which means we need to multiply this probability by 2 to obtain the probability that either case occurs. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }\frac{7}{22}}$.

Model Final Answer #2: A
Model Answer #2: We can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE) to solve this problem. Let $Q_R$ denote the set of vertices $S$ such that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$, and similarly for $R_Q$. We want to find the probability that $S \not\in Q_R$; this is simply $1 - P(S \in Q_R)$. By PIE, we have $|Q_R \cup R_Q| = |Q_R| + |R_Q| - |Q_R \cap R_Q|$. 
We compute each of these values separately.

$|Q_R|$: For any vertex $R$, there are $12$ vertices $Q$ such that $d(Q, R) = 2$ (choose a vertex $Q'$ such that $d(R, Q') = 2$, and then choose the unique vertex $Q$ such that $d(Q, Q') = 1$). Thus, $|Q_R| = 12 \cdot 20 = 240$.
$|R_Q|$: By the same logic, $|R_Q| = 12 \cdot 20 = 240$.
$|Q_R \cap R_Q|$: For any vertex $R$, there are $5$ vertices $Q$ such that $d(Q, R) = 1$ (choose a vertex $Q'$ such that $d(R, Q') = 2$, and then choose one of the $5$ vertices adjacent to $Q'$). Thus, $|Q_R \cap R_Q| = 5 \cdot 20 = 100$.

Substituting these values into our expression for $|Q_R \cup R_Q|$, we have $|Q_R \cup R_Q| = 240 + 240 - 100 = 380$. Since there are $20$ total vertices, the probability is $\frac{20 - 380}{20} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) } \frac{7}{22}}$.

Model Final Answer #3: D
Model Answer #3: We will use casework to solve this problem.
Case 1: $d(Q, R) = 1$.
In this case, $Q$ and $R$ are adjacent vertices. Then, there are three possible vertices for $S$.
Case 2: $d(Q, R) = 2$.
In this case, $Q$ and $R$ are not adjacent vertices, but there exists a vertex $P$ such that $d(Q, P) = 1$ and $d(P, R) = 1$. Then, there are seven possible vertices for $S$ ($S$ cannot be $P$, $Q$, or $R$).
Case 3: $d(Q, R) = 3$.
In this case, $Q$ and $R$ are not adjacent vertices, and there is no vertex $P$ such that $d(Q, P) = 1$ and $d(P, R) = 1$. Then, there are ten possible vertices for $S$ ($S$ cannot be $Q$ or $R$).
Therefore, there are $3 + 7 + 10 = 20$ possible values of $(Q, R, S)$ such that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$. There are $\binom{12}{3} = 220$ total possible values of $(Q, R, S)$. Therefore, the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is $\frac{20}{220} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }\frac{5}{12}}$.

Model Final Answer #4: A
Model Answer #4: We can approach this problem geometrically. The $20$ triangles of the icosahedron can be divided into $12$ congruent isosceles triangles, each with two equal sides of length $1$ and a base of length $\sqrt {3}$, and $20 - 12 = 8$ congruent isosceles triangles, each with two equal sides of length $\sqrt {3}$ and a base of length $1$. The $12$ congruent isosceles triangles have vertices at the top and bottom of the icosahedron (which we'll call "top" and "bottom"), and the midpoints of the sides of the icosahedron (which we'll call "side" vertices). The $8$ congruent isosceles triangles have vertices at pairs of adjacent side vertices and a pair of adjacent vertices at the top or bottom of the icosahedron (which we'll call "vertex" vertices).
Note that the isosceles triangles are the only ones we need to consider because each path has to consist of $2$ isosceles triangles. WLOG, let $d(A, B) = 1$ and $d(B, C) = 1$. Then the triangles with $A$ and $B$ as vertices are the only ones we need to consider. The desired probability is then equal to the probability that the third vertex $C$ of a randomly chosen triangle with vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$ is closer to $B$ than to $A$.

We will consider two cases:

Case 1: $C$ is a top or bottom vertex.
In this case, $C$ is closer to $B$ than to $A$ if and only if it shares an edge with $B$. Since there are $2$ top and bottom vertices, the probability that $C$ shares an edge with $B$ is $\frac {2}{20} = \frac {1}{10}$.

Case 2: $C$ is a side or vertex vertex.
In this case, $C$ is closer to $B$ than to $A$ if and only if it shares an edge with $B$, or it shares an edge with a top or bottom vertex that shares an edge with $B$. There are $2$ side vertices and $2$ vertex vertices, so the probability that $C$ shares an edge with $B$ or shares an edge with a top or bottom vertex that shares an edge with $B$ is $\frac {4}{20} = \frac {1}{5}$.

Therefore, the probability that $C$ is closer to $B$ than to $A$ is $\frac {1}{10}\cdot \frac {2}{3} + \frac {1}{5}\cdot \frac {1}{3} = \boxed{\frac {7}{22}}$.

Model Final Answer #5: C
Model Answer #5: We claim that once $S$ is chosen, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{3}{8}}$. We know that $\binom{20}{3}$ is the total number of ways to choose $Q$, $R$, and $S$. Given that $S$ is chosen, we see that there are $10$ edges coming out of $S$. Let the number of edges coming out of $S$ that lead to $Q$ be $x$, and let the number of edges coming out of $S$ that lead to $R$ be $y$. We have $x+y=10$, and we want $x > y$. The possible pairs $(x,y)$ are $(9,1),(8,2),\ldots,(1,9)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, so $x$ and $y$ can each have values from $0$ to $10$ inclusive, except for $(5,5)$. (We subtract $(5,5)$ because that would mean $Q$ and $R$ are the same vertex.) So there are $20-1-10=9$ pairs $(x,y)$, giving us $9$ possible ways to choose $Q$ and $R$ given $S$. So the answer is $\frac{9}{\binom{20}{3}} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{3}{8}}$.

Model Final Answer #6: D
Model Answer #6: There are two cases. Either $R$ is adjacent to both $Q$ and $S$, or $R$ is not adjacent to both $Q$ and $S$.
Case 1: $R$ is adjacent to both $Q$ and $S$. In this case, $d(Q, R) = d(R, S) = 1$, so $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is impossible.
Case 2: $R$ is not adjacent to both $Q$ and $S$. In this case, $d(Q, R) = 2$ and $d(R, S) = 1$, so $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is guaranteed.
Since there is only one way for $R$ to be adjacent to both $Q$ and $S$, the probability of case 1 occurring is $\frac{3}{19} \cdot \frac{2}{18} = \frac{1}{57}$.
Since there are $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways for $R$ to not be adjacent to both $Q$ and $S$, the probability of case 2 occurring is $\frac{10}{19} \cdot \frac{9}{18} = \frac{5}{19}$.
Therefore, the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is $\frac{5}{19}$, which is answer $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$.

Adding up all of these cases, we get $\frac{1}{18} + \frac{1}{306} + \frac{1}{288} + \frac{1}{288} + \frac{1}{6528} + \frac{1}{4896} + \frac{1}{42336} + \frac{1}{39408} + \frac{1}{196560} + \frac{1}{163680} + \frac{1}{2125760} + \frac{11}{2784600} + \frac{3}{605040} + \frac{1}{3084480} + \frac{1}{26542080} + \frac{1}{344594880} + \frac{11}{439084160} + \frac{9}{584112384} + \frac{1}{196560} + \frac{1}{163680} + \frac{1}{2125760} + \frac{11}{2784600} + \frac{3}{605040} + \frac{1}{3084480} + \frac{1}{26542080} + \frac{1}{344594880} + \frac{11}{439084160} + \frac{9}{584112384} + \frac{1}{196560} + \frac{1}{163680} + \frac{1}{2125760} + \frac{11}{2784600} + \frac{3}{605040} + \frac{1}{3084480} + \frac{1}{26542080} + \frac{1}{344594880} + \frac{11}{439084160} + \frac{9}{584112384} + \frac{7}{196560} + \frac{7}{163680} + \frac{7}{2125760} + \frac{7}{2784600} + \frac{7}{605040} + \frac{7}{3084480} + \frac{7}{26542080} + \frac{7}{344594880} + \frac{7}{439084160} + \frac{7}{584112384} + \frac{7}{196560} + \frac{7}{163680} + \frac{7}{2125760} + \frac{7}{2784600} + \frac{7}{605040} + \frac{7}{3084480} + \frac{7}{26542080} + \frac{7}{344594880} + \frac{7}{439084160} + \frac{7}{584112384} + \frac{7}{196560} + \frac{7}{163680} + \frac{7}{2125760} + \frac{7}{2784600} + \frac{7}{605040} + \frac{7}{3084480} + \frac{7}{26542080} + \frac{7}{344594880} + \frac{7}{439084160} + \frac{7}{584112384} = \boxed{\text{(C)}\ \frac{3}{8}}$.

Model Final Answer #8: abstain
Model Answer #8: The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the icosahedron has a lot of symmetry, and that we can use this symmetry to our advantage. We can use casework to count how many possible values for $d(Q,R)$ there are and how many possible values for $d(R,S)$ there are. Then, we can count the number of cases in which $d(Q,R) > d(R,S)$, and divide that by the total number of cases to get our probability. We will do this casework by considering the possible values of $d(Q,R)$ and $d(R,S)$ and determining the number of cases for each.
Case 1: $d(Q,R) = 1$.
If $d(Q,R) = 1$, then $Q$ and $R$ are adjacent vertices, which means they are connected by an edge. Similarly, if $d(R,S) = 1$, then $R$ and $S$ are connected by an edge. If we consider the icosahedron, we can see that for each of the $20$ vertices, there are three vertices that are adjacent to it, meaning that there are $3$ possible vertices that $R$ can be in this case. Because there are $20$ vertices for $Q$, there are a total of $20 \cdot 3 = 60$ cases for this subcase.
Case 2: $d(Q,R) = 2$.
If $d(Q,R) = 2$, then $Q$ and $R$ are not adjacent vertices, but they share a common vertex. If $R$ is adjacent to $Q$, then $d(R,S) = 1$. However, if $R$ is not adjacent to $Q$, then $d(R,S) = 2$. If we consider the icosahedron, we can see that for each of the $20$ vertices, there are $5$ vertices that are two edges away from it, meaning that there are $5$ possible vertices that $R$ can be in this case. Because there are $20$ vertices for $Q$, there are a total of $20 \cdot 5 = 100$ cases for this subcase.
Case 3: $d(Q,R) = 3$.
If $d(Q,R) = 3$, then $Q$ and $R$ are not adjacent vertices and they do not share a common vertex. If $R$ is adjacent to $Q$, then $d(R,S) = 1$. If $R$ shares a common vertex with $Q$, but is not adjacent to it, then $d(R,S) = 2$. If $R$ is not adjacent to or does not share a common vertex with $Q$, then $d(R,S) = 3$. If we consider the icosahedron, we can see that for each of the $20$ vertices, there are $2$ vertices that are three edges away from it, meaning that there are $2$ possible vertices that $R$ can be in this case. Because there are $20$ vertices for $Q$, there are a total of $20 \cdot 2 = 40$ cases for this subcase.
Case 4: $d(Q,R) = 4$.
If $d(Q,R) = 4$, then $Q$ and $R$ are not adjacent vertices and they do not share a common vertex. If $R$ is adjacent to $Q$, then $d(R,S) = 1$. If $R$ shares a common vertex with $Q$, but is not adjacent to it, then $d(R,S) = 2$. If $R$ is not adjacent to or does not share a common vertex with $Q$, then $d(R,S) = 3$. If we consider the icosahedron, we can see that for each of the $20$ vertices, there is $1$ vertex that is four edges away from it. Because there are $20$ vertices for $Q$, there are a total of $20$ cases for this subcase.
Case 5: $d(Q,R) = 5$.
If $d(Q,R) = 5$, then $Q$ and $R$ are not adjacent vertices and they do not share a common vertex. If $R$ is adjacent to $Q$, then $d(R,S) = 1$. If $R$ shares a common vertex with $Q$, but is not adjacent to it, then $d(R,S) = 2$. If $R$ is not adjacent to or does not share a common vertex with $Q$, then $d(R,S) = 3$. If we consider the icosahedron, we can see that for each of the $20$ vertices, there is no vertex that is five edges away from it. Because there are $20$ vertices for $Q$, there are a total of $0$ cases for this subcase.
Thus, we have a total of $60 + 100 + 40 + 20 + 0 = 220$ cases that we need to consider.
To count the number of cases in which $d(Q,R) > d(R,S)$, we need to count the number of cases in which $d(R,S) \le d(Q,R)$. We can do this by considering the cases for $d(Q,R)$ and $d(R,S)$ that we have already considered.
If $d(Q,R) = 1$, then $d(R,S)$ can be either $1$ or $2$, so there are $2$ cases for this subcase.
If $d(Q,R) = 2$, then $d(R,S)$ can be either $1$ or $2$, so there are $2$ cases for this subcase.
If $d(Q,R) = 3$, then $d(R,S)$ can either be $1$, $2$, or $3$, so there are $3$ cases for this subcase.
If $d(Q,R) = 4$, then $d(R,S)$ can either be $1$, $2$, $3$, or $4$, so there are $4$ cases for this subcase.
If $d(Q,R) = 5$, then $d(R,S)$ can either be $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, or $5$, so there are $5$ cases for this subcase.
Thus, there are a total of $2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 16$ cases in which $d(Q,R) > d(R,S)$.
Therefore, the probability that $d(Q,R) > d(R,S)$ is $\frac{16}{220} = \boxed{\frac{2}{27}}$.

Model Final Answer #9: abstain
Model Answer #9: We can set $Q$ at the top vertex of the icosahedron. Thus, $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ if and only if $R$ and $S$ are both below the midline of the icosahedron.
[asy] import three; unitsize(1cm); size(200); currentprojection=perspective(1/2,-1,1/2); triple A=(-1/2,-1/2,-1/2),B=(1/2,-1/2,-1/2),C=(1/2,1/2,-1/2),D=(-1/2,1/2,-1/2),E=(0,0,sqrt(2)-1/2),F=(0,0,1/2); triple H=(0,0,3/2-sqrt(5)/2); triple G=(2/5,2/5,2/5); draw(G--A--B--G--C--D--G--A--E--B--E--C--E--D); draw(A--F--B--F--C--F--D--F--A);  dot(G^^A^^B^^C^^D^^E^^F); label("$Q$",G,NW); label("$R$",A,SW); label("$S$",B,SE); [/asy]
Notice that when $S$ is below the midline, there is one possibility for $R$ (the bottom vertex), when $S$ is on the midline, there are two possibilities for $R$ (the bottom two vertices), and when $S$ is above the midline, there are three possibilities for $R$ (the bottom three vertices).
Thus, there are $1+2+3=6$ possibilities for $(R, S)$. Since there are $\dbinom{20}{2}=190$ possible pairs of vertices for $(R, S)$, the probability is $\dfrac{6}{190}=\boxed{\frac{3}{95}}$.

Model Final Answer #10: A
Model Answer #10: There are three possibilities for the configuration of $Q, R, S$. Either $Q, R, S$ are all adjacent vertices of an icosahedron, $Q, R, S$ are all "corner" vertices, or $Q, R, S$ are a mix of the two.
Case 1: $Q, R, S$ are adjacent vertices.
In this case, $d(Q, R) = d(R, S) = 1$, so $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is false.
Case 2: $Q, R, S$ are "corner" vertices.
In this case, $Q, R, S$ are three vertices of a regular pentagon. There are $12$ possible pentagons. We will count the number of pentagons where $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$. Without loss of generality, let $Q$ be the vertex closest to the center of the regular pentagon. Then, $d(Q, R)$ is at least $2$, as it is the distance of the two vertices of a regular pentagon farthest apart. The distance between $R$ and $S$ is at most $2$, as they are adjacent vertices. So, $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is true. There are $12$ possibilities here.
Case 3: $Q, R, S$ are a mix of adjacent vertices and "corner" vertices.
In this case, $Q$ and $S$ are adjacent vertices, $R$ is a "corner" vertex, and $R$ is not the vertex between $Q$ and $S$. We will count the number of possible configurations here. There are $20$ choices for $R$. We can then rotate the icosahedron such that $Q$ is the vertex closest to the center of one of the regular pentagons. Then, there are $2$ choices for $S$ (the vertex adjacent to $Q$). So, there are $40$ possibilities here.
Therefore, there are $12 + 40 = 52$ possibilities for $Q, R, S$ where $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$. There are $\binom{12}{3}$ total possibilities for $Q, R, S$.
The probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is $\frac{52}{\binom{12}{3}} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) } \frac{7}{22}}$.
